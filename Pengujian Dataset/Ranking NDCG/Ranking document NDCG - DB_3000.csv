What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"this category of machine learning is termed as supervised learning? This category is termed as supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher teaching his students. The algorithm continuously predicts the result on the basis of training data and is continuously corrected by the teacher. The learning continues until the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance. Supervised Learning Use-cases Cortana Cortana or any speech automated system in your mobile phone trains your voice and then starts working based on this training. This is an application of Supervised Learning Weather Apps Predicts the upcoming weather by analyzing the parameters for a given time on some prior knowledge (when its sunny, temperature is higher; when its cloudy, humidity is higher, etc.). Biometric Attendance In Biometric Attendance you can train the machine with inputs of your biometric identity — it can be your thumb, iris or ear-lobe, etc. Once the machine is trained it can validate your future input and can easily identify you. Understanding Unsupervised Learning So, what is Unsupervised Learning? Mathematically, Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data. Let me rephrase it for you in simple terms: In the unsupervised learning approach, the sample of a training dataset does not have an expected output associated with them. Using the unsupervised learning algorithms you can detect patterns based on the typical characteristics of the input data. Clustering can be considered as an example of a machine learning task that uses the unsupervised learning approach. The machine then groups similar data samples and identify different clusters within the data. Now let me tell you why this category of machine learning is known as unsupervised learning? Well, this category of machine learning is known as unsupervised because unlike supervised learning there is no teacher. Algorithms are left on their own to discover and return the interesting structure in the data. Unsupervised Learning Usecases A friend invites you to his party where you meet totally strangers. Now you will classify them using unsupervised learning (no prior knowledge) and this classification can be on the basis of gender, age group, dressing, educational qualification or whatever way you would like. Since you didn’t have any prior knowledge about people and so you just classified them “on-the-go”. Let’s suppose you have never seen a Football match before and by chance watch a video on the internet, now you can classify players on the basis of different criterion like Players wearing the same sort of kits are in one class, Players of one style are in one class (players, goalkeeper, referee), or on the basis of playing style(attacker or",3
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"Let’s break down three key types of machine learning in a way that’s easy to follow. Unsupervised learning is when the computer doesn’t get any labels. It’s like being given a set of puzzles with no instructions. The computer’s job is to find patterns and group similar things together. For example, it might look at a bunch of animal photos and group them based on common traits, even if it doesn’t know the names. The great thing about this approach is that it’s perfect for discovering hidden patterns. The downside? The computer might group things in ways that don’t always make sense to us. Supervised learning is like learning with a teacher who gives you both questions and answers. Imagine showing a computer a bunch of images labeled “cat” or “dog.” The machine looks for patterns, learning what makes each animal unique. Over time, it can predict whether new pictures show cats or dogs, based on the patterns it’s seen. The big advantage? It’s fast because the computer has clear guidance. The downside? You need a lot of labeled data, which can take time to prepare. Reinforcement learning is more like a game. The computer learns by trying actions and receiving feedback — rewards for good choices, penalties for mistakes. Think of training a robot to navigate a maze. It tries different paths, and each time it hits a wall, it learns to avoid that route next time. The benefit here is that it can learn complex tasks over time. The challenge? It takes a lot of trial and error for the computer to figure out the best approach. Supervised Learning: Guided Learning with Answers Reinforcement Learning: Learning by Trying and Failing Unsupervised Learning: Figuring Things Out on Your Own Now you see how these different approaches make machines smarter. From helping us find better movie recommendations to improving game AI, machine learning is part of our everyday lives.

What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is simply the strategy of making a machine learn from data. When going deep, we can say that Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers the ability to learn and improve on their own experience without being explicitly programmed. Mainly there are three types of methods in which machine learning algorithms learn. They are… Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning Reinforcement Learning In a supervised learning process, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions called the labels. This means, there are already some data that consist of the desired answers or output in the dataset itself. Let’s understand the concept of supervised learning with an example, take the case of a five-year-old student, he/she is not likely to understand the subjects without the help of his/her teacher. So there he/she needs a supervisor for learning the subjects. In the same way, our supervised learning algorithm is also like a five-year-old child which cannot learn without the help of a supervisor. So to make a model more Supervised Learning efficient, we need to train them continuously with the labeled training data to yield a good result. After the algorithm learns the rules and patterns of the data, it creates a model which is an algorithmic equation for producing output data with the rules and patterns derived from training data. Here we are giving all labels to the algorithm to predict the outcome. Once the algorithm is well trained with the data it can be launched in the real world. important supervised learning algorithms: Linear Regression Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines(SVM) k-Nearest Neighbors Decision Tree & Random Forests Neural Networks Supervised Learning Model Unsupervised Learning Important Unsupervised Learning algorithms Important Unsupervised learning algorithms: Clustering K-Means DBSCAN Hierarchical Cluster Analysis(HCA) Anomaly detection and novelty detection One-class-SVM Isolation Forest In unsupervised learning, the data patterns are not classified. Instead, the algorithm tries to uncover the hidden patterns in a dataset and create labels. This means the unsupervised learning algorithms are able to classify the overall data into groups of data that are quite similar in their features. Suppose you want to identify which type of customers are mostly attracted to your products, you can classify them into different groups using unsupervised learning algorithms based on their purchasing behavior and can identify which type of customers are most attracted to your product. In industry, unsupervised learning is particularly powerful in fraud detection where the most dangerous attacks are often those yet to be classified. Moreover, it is used in spam filtering, fraudulent transactions, fraudulent online activities, etc. Unsupervised Learning Model Association rule learning Apriori Eclat Visualization and dimensionality reduction",2

Now that we understand what machine learning is, let’s go straight into the definition aspect of this article. Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as “training data”, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. According to McKinsey, he defined Machine learning as the: “algorithms that can learn from data without relying on rules-based programming. According to Arthur Samuel, he said: Machine learning is the ability of a computer to perform task itself without being explicitly programmed. Types of Machine learning Machine learning can be classified into 4 types of algorithms. 1. Supervised learning 2. Unsupervised learning 3. Semi-supervised learning 4. Reinforcement learning Supervised learning Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples. Types of Supervised learning 1. Classification : Classification is a type of supervised learning. It specifies the class to which data elements belong to and is best used when the output has finite and discrete values. It predicts a class for an input variable as well. Example: Spam detection, Churn prediction, Sentiment analysis e.t.c 2. Regression : Regression analysis is a subfield of supervised machine learning. It aims to model the relationship between a certain number of features and a continuous target variable. Example: Predicting stock prices, predicting prices of homes e.t.c Supervised Machine learning Algorithm 1. K-nearest Neighbors 2. Linear Regression 3. Support vector machines 4. Decision tree 5.

Neural Networks Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision. Types of Unsupervised learning Algorithm 1. Clustering [K-means] : Clustering is a Machine Learning technique that involves the grouping of data points. In theory, data points that are in the same group should have similar properties and/or features, while data points in different groups should have highly dissimilar properties and/or features.

At its core, machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. In other words, machine learning algorithms enable computers to identify patterns, recognize trends, and make predictions by learning from examples and past experiences. This ability to learn from data and adapt over time is what sets machine learning apart and makes it a powerful tool for solving complex problems. Google Images Applications of Machine Learning Machine learning finds applications across a wide range of domains, including: 1. Finance: Predicting stock prices, credit risk assessment, fraud detection. 2. Healthcare: Disease diagnosis, medical image analysis, drug discovery. 3. Marketing: Customer segmentation, recommendation systems, personalized advertising. 4. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Sentiment analysis, language translation, chatbots. 5. Computer Vision: Object detection, facial recognition, autonomous vehicles. 6. Gaming: Character behavior modeling, opponent AI, procedural content generation. 7. Manufacturing: Quality control, predictive maintenance, supply chain optimization. These are just a few examples, showcasing the diverse and impactful applications of machine learning in today’s world. Types of Machine Learning Machine learning can be broadly categorized into three main types: 1. Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled examples in the form of input-output pairs. It aims to map inputs to correct outputs by identifying patterns in the data. Common algorithms include linear regression (for regression tasks) and classification algorithms like decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. 2. Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised learning involves learning patterns and structures from unlabeled data. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are typical tasks in unsupervised learning. K-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) are popular unsupervised algorithms. 3. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement learning is inspired by behavioral psychology, where an agent learns how to interact with an environment to maximize rewards. It involves taking actions in an environment to achieve a specific goal. Reinforcement learning is widely used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems. 4. Semi-Supervised Learning(optinal): Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm that leverages a small labeled dataset and a larger unlabeled dataset to improve model performance by combining supervised and unsupervised techniques. It’s used in scenarios where obtaining fully labeled data is costly or time-consuming, such as in medical image analysis and natural language processing tasks.

What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"Preprint submitted to the 6th ASMO UK / ISSMO conference.

Traditional methods present a very  restrictive range of applications, mainly limited by the features  of the function to be optimized and of the constraint functions.  In contrast, evolutionary algorithms present almost no  restriction to the features of these functions, although the most  appropriate constraint-handling technique is still an open  question. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is  sometimes viewed as another evolutionary algorithm because  of their many similarities, despite not being inspired by the  same metaphor. Namely, they evolve a population of  individuals taking into consideration previous experiences and  using stochastic operators to introduce new responses. The  advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to  traditional methods have been greatly discussed in the  literature for decades. While all such advantages are valid  when comparing the PSO paradigm to traditional methods, its  main advantages with respect to evolutionary algorithms  consist of its noticeably lower computational cost and easier  implementation. In fact, the plain version can be programmed  in a few lines of code, involving no operator design and few  parameters to be tuned. This paper deals with three important  aspects of the method: the influence of the parameters’ tuning  on the behaviour of the system; the design of stopping criteria  so that the reliability of the solution found can be somehow  estimated and computational cost can be saved; and the  development of appropriate techniques to handle constraints,  given that the original method is designed for unconstrained  optimization problems.  INTRODUCTION  Optimization is the process of seeking the combination  of variables that leads to the best performance of the  model, where “best” is measured according to a pre- defined criterion, usually subject to a set of constraints.  Thus, setting different combinations of values of the  “variables” allows trying different candidate solutions,  the “constraints” limit the valid combinations, and the  “optimality criterion” allows differentiating better from  worse. Traditional optimization methods exhibit several  weaknesses such as a number of requirements that either  the function to be optimized or the",1
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"A particle swarm searching for the global minimum of a function Particle swarm optimization In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO)[1] is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search- space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions. PSO is originally attributed to Kennedy, Eberhart and Shi[2][3] and was first intended for simulating social behaviour,[4] as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The book by Kennedy and Eberhart[5] describes many philosophical aspects of PSO and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of PSO applications is made by Poli.[6][7] In 2017, a comprehensive review on theoretical and experimental works on PSO has been published by Bonyadi and Michalewicz.[1] PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. Also, PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi- newton methods. However, metaheuristics such as PSO do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found. A basic variant of the PSO algorithm works by having a population (called a swarm) of candidate solutions (called particles). These particles are moved around in the search-space according to a few simple formulae.[8] The movements of the particles are guided by their own best-known position in the search-space as well as the entire swarm's best-known position. When improved positions are being discovered these will then come to guide the movements of the swarm. The process is repeated and by doing so it is hoped, but not guaranteed, that a satisfactory solution will eventually be discovered. Formally, let f:  ℝn  → ℝ be the cost function which must be minimized. The function takes a candidate solution as an argument in the form of a vector of real numbers and produces a real number as output which indicates the objective function value of the given candidate solution.

What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"Preprint submitted to Trends in Engineering Computational Technology  doi:10.4203/csets.20.6  1  Abstract    The advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to traditional methods have  been greatly discussed in the literature. While particle swarm optimizers share such  advantages, they outperform evolutionary algorithms in that they require lower  computational cost and easier implementation, involving no operator design and few  coefficients to be tuned. However, even marginal variations in the settings of these  coefficients greatly influence the dynamics of the swarm. Since this paper does not  intend to study their tuning, general-purpose settings are taken from previous stud- ies, and virtually the same algorithm is used to optimize a variety of notably differ- ent problems. Thus, following a review of the paradigm, the algorithm is tested on a  set of benchmark functions and engineering problems taken from the literature. Lat- er, complementary lines of code are incorporated to adapt the method to combinato- rial optimization as it occurs in scheduling problems, and a real case is solved using  the same optimizer with the same settings. The aim is to show the flexibility and ro- bustness of the approach, which can handle a wide variety of problems.

May 22, 2024 Abstract General purpose optimization routines such as nlminb, optim (R) or nlmixed (SAS) are frequently used to estimate model parameters in nonstandard distributions. This paper presents Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), as an alternative to many of the current algorithms used in statistics. We find that PSO can not only reproduce the same results as the above routines, it can also produce results that are more optimal or when others cannot converge. In the latter case, it can also identify the source of the problem or problems. We highlight advantages of using PSO using four examples, where: (1) some parameters in a generalized distribution are unidentified using PSO when it is not apparent or computationally manifested using routines in R or SAS; (2) PSO can produce estimation results for the log-binomial regressions when current routines may not; (3) PSO provides flexibility in the link function for binomial regression with LASSO penalty, which is unsupported by standard packages like GLM and GENMOD in Stata and SAS, respectively, and (4) PSO provides superior MLE estimates for an EE-IW distribution compared with those from the traditional statistical methods that rely on moments. Keywords: convergence failure, generalized distribution, log-binomial model, metaheuristics, singular Hessian, unidentified parameters. 1 An Overview of PSO Metaheuristics, and in particular, nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, is increasingly used across disciplines to tackle challenging optimization problems [11]. They may be broadly categorized swarm based or evolutionary based algorithms. Some examples of the former are particle swarm optimization and competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) and examples of the latter are genetic algorithm (GA) and the differential evolution. The statistical community is probably most aware of GA and simulated annealing (SA) but they are many others that have recently proven more popular in engineering and computer science. [24] provides the latest comprehensive review of nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a stochastic numerical search algorithm that has garnered widespread acclaim among scholars across various disciplines. Initially conceptualized by Kennedy & Eberhart in 1995 [23], PSO draws inspiration from the biological swarm behavior of birds, emulating their leaderless yet highly coordinated approach to locate food targets. This intriguing aspect of animal swarms is meticulously captured in PSO.

What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"deterministic, analytical ap- proaches. While the advantages of PSO and EAs with respect to traditional methods  are roughly the same, the main advantages of PSO when compared to EAs are its  lower computational cost and easier implementation. Regarding their drawbacks,  both these methods require higher computational effort, some constraint-handling  technique incorporated, and find it hard to handle equality constraints.    Population-based methods like EAs and PSO are considered modern heuristics  because they are not designed to optimize a given problem deterministically but to  carry out some procedures that are not directly related to the optimization problem.  Optimization occurs without evident links between the implemented technique and  the resulting optimization process. They are also viewed as Artificial Intelligence  (AI) techniques because their ability to optimize is an emergent property that is not  specifically intended, and therefore not implemented in the code. Thus, the problem  per se is not analytically solved, but artificial-intelligent entities are implemented,  which are expected to find a solution themselves. In particular, Swarm Intelligence  (SI) is the branch of AI concerned with the study of the collective behaviour that  emerges from decentralized and self-organized systems. It is the property of a sys- tem whose individual parts interact locally with one another and with their environ- ment, inducing the emergence of coherent global patterns that the individual parts  are unaware of. PSO is viewed as one of the most prominent SI-based methods. Ei- ther modern heuristics or AI-based optimizers, these methods are not deterministi- cally designed to optimize. EAs perform some kind of artificial evolution, where  individuals in a population undergo simulated evolutionary processes which results  in the maximization of a fitness function, resembling biological evolution. Likewise,  PSO consists of a sort of simulation of a social milieu, where the ability of the popu- lation to optimize its performance emerges from the cooperation among individuals.    Although the basic particle swarm optimizer requires the tuning of a few coeffi- cients only, even marginal variations in their values have a strong impact on the dy- namics of the swarm. The general-purpose settings used throughout this paper were  taken from previous studies (see Innocente [2]) because the objective is not to study  their tuning but to demonstrate that virtually the same algorithm is able to cope with  a variety of problems that would require different traditional methods to be solved.  Thus, this paper intends to introduce the PSO method, pose the optimization and  scheduling problems, and solve them with essentially the same algorithm. Addition- al code is required to turn the continuous search algorithm into a scheduler.    2  Mathematical optimization    For problems where the quality of a solution can be quantified in a numerical value,",3

How is AI used in everyday life?,"revolves around a position defined by John Searle as ""strong AI"": A physical symbol system can have a mind and mental states.[9] Searle distinguished this position from what he called ""weak AI"": A physical symbol system can act intelligently.[9] Searle introduced the terms to isolate strong AI from weak AI so he could focus on what he thought was the more interesting and debatable issue. He argued that even if we assume that we had a computer program that acted exactly like a human mind, there would still be a difficult philosophical question that needed to be answered.[9] Can a machine have a mind, consciousness, and mental states? 8/6/24, 6:11 PM Philosophy of artificial intelligence - Wikipedia  6/20 Neither of Searle's two positions are of great concern to AI research, since they do not directly answer the question ""can a machine display general intelligence?"" (unless it can also be shown that consciousness is necessary for intelligence). Turing wrote ""I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness… [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think].""[53] Russell and Norvig agree: ""Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.""[54] There are a few researchers who believe that consciousness is an essential element in intelligence, such as Igor Aleksander, Stan Franklin, Ron Sun, and Pentti Haikonen, although their definition of ""consciousness"" strays very close to ""intelligence"". (See artificial consciousness.) Before we can answer this question, we must be clear what we mean by ""minds"", ""mental states"" and ""consciousness"". The words ""mind"" and ""consciousness"" are used by different communities in different ways. Some new age thinkers, for example, use the word ""consciousness"" to describe something similar to Bergson's ""élan vital"": an invisible, energetic fluid that permeates life and especially the mind. Science fiction writers use the word to describe some essential property that makes us human: a machine or alien that is ""conscious"" will be presented as a fully human character, with intelligence, desires, will, insight, pride and so on. (Science fiction writers also use the words ""sentience"", ""sapience"", ""self-awareness"" or ""ghost""—as in the Ghost in the Shell manga and anime series—to describe this essential human property). For others , the words ""mind"" or ""consciousness"" are used as a kind of secular synonym for the soul. For philosophers, neuroscientists and cognitive scientists, the words are used in a way that is both more precise and more mundane: they refer to the familiar, everyday experience of having a ""thought in your head"", like a perception, a dream, an intention or a plan, and to the way we see something, know something, mean something or understand something.[55] ""It's not hard to give a commonsense definition of consciousness"" observes",0

However, for researchers, it can be considered that sky is not the limit for new inventions. So, they tried to create a “man-made homosapien” species, which can be related to the world of computers in the form of AI (which are Artiﬁcial, i.e., manmade, and Intel- ligence, i.e., has thinking power). If a system can have the basic skills like learning, reasoning, self-improvement (by learning from experience), language understanding, and solving problems, then it can be assumed that there is the existence of AI. The AI has been used and implemented in many ﬁelds especially in technological domain and is expected to provide 2.3 million jobs by 2020. It is a cutting-edge technology which has its impact in almost every ﬁeld, be it business, defense, aerospace, or health care systems. It can also be denoted as the method of simulation of human intelli- gence designed or programmed by humans. With the help of AI, a well-equipped life is generated where the automated machines work for humans, saving their time and energy. Basically, two types of assistants are considered for humans, manual (in the form of robots), and digital (Chatbots) which can perform risky, repetitive, and troublesome tasks. The task of developing such machines is accomplished by minutely studying the human behavior and implementing the logic in the form of algorithms resulting in inventions of software, devices, robots, etc., making human race smarter. There are many areas which contribute to artiﬁcial intelligence which includes mathematics (used for developing algorithms), biology, philosophy, psychology, neuroscience (for studying human mind and its behavior), statistics (for handling huge data), and last but not the least, computer science (to run the algorithm for implementing the concepts). The basic aim of AI is to provide more transparent, interpretable, and explainable systems which can help to establish a better-equipped system used as an intelligent agent. The concept of trusting machine as a replica of human started with the invent of turing test in which the machine is tested irrespective of the knowledge of examiner upon the instructions given considering it as human and if it passes the test, the machine is considered as intelligent. No wonder AI has affected many aspects of the society and presented a new modern era in this digital revolution. 1.1 Types of AI (Based on Capabilities) The various types of artiﬁcial intelligence based on the capabilities can be classiﬁed as – Weak or narrow AI – General AI – Strong AI. Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 25 Weak or narrow AI: it is a type of AI which can perform a predeﬁned narrow set of instructions without exhibiting any thinking capability. It is the most widely used type of AI in this world. Some famous examples are Apples’s Siri, Alexa, Alpha Go, IBM’s Watson supercomputer, Sophia (the humanoid) all belong to the weak AI type",2
How is AI used in everyday life?,"AI can be categorized into two main types: 1. Narrow AI (or Weak AI): This type of AI is programmed to perform a narrow task like facial recognition, internet searches, or driving a car. Most of the AI encountered in day-to-day life, from chatbots to virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, falls under this category. Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a frontier in computer science, aiming to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. In essence, AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It’s related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to biologically observable methods. Defining AI The definition of AI is often a topic of debate, but at its core, it involves machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include planning, understanding language, recognizing objects and sounds, learning, and problem solving. We can consider AI to be a system that perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Brief History of AI AI as a concept has been around for centuries, with roots in Greek mythology. Modern AI, however, began in the 20th century with the development of the Turing Test by Alan Turing, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called “intelligent.” The field of AI research was formally founded at a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956. Types of AI Recently in technology, two terms frequently come up: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Often used interchangeably, these terms actually describe different, though closely related, concepts in the realm of computer science. The goal of this article is to explain these concepts in a simple, straightforward manner, making them accessible to those with little or no existing knowledge in the field. I aim to provide a clear understanding of both AI and ML, how they work, and what differentiates them. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? 2. General AI (or Strong AI): This is a type of AI that has a broader range and is more akin to human cognition. It can intelligently solve a variety of problems, learn new tasks, and perform a variety of tasks. General AI is still a largely theoretical concept, with no existing examples as of now. As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, ethical considerations are increasingly important. Issues like privacy, security, and the potential impact on employment are significant topics of discussion. Ensuring that AI benefits society while minimizing its risks is a challenge that needs ongoing attention.

Now, lets look into what each term means. What is AI, ML, and DL? AI: Developing machines to mimic human intelligence and behavior Artificial intelligence is the broad idea that machines can intelligently execute tasks by mimicking human behaviors and thought process using algorithms, data, and models. AI predicts, automates, and complete tasks typically done by humans with greater accuracy and precision, reduces bias, cost and timesaving. What is learning? We learn things in certain ways. How do human generally learn? Remember, generalize and keep adapting to changing things. We will incorporate these things into machines. ML: Algorithms that learn from structured data to predict output and discover patterns in that data. Machine learning, a subset of AI, revolves around the idea that machines can learn and adapt through experiences and data to complete specific tasks. This uses methods from statistics, operational research, and physics to find hidden insights within data without being programmed where to look or what to conclude. Machine learning is used to develop self-learning processing where software is given instructions on accomplishing a specific task. An example would be predicting the weather forecast for the next seven days based on data from previous year and previous week. Every day, the data from the previous year/week changes, so the ML model must adapt to the new data. 8/12/24, 11:00 AM Introduction to AI.

What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Heuristic (computer science) In mathematical optimization and computer science, heuristic (from Greek εὑρίσκω ""I find, discover""[1]) is a technique designed for problem solving more quickly when classic methods are too slow for finding an exact or approximate solution, or when classic methods fail to find any exact solution in a search space. This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for speed. In a way, it can be considered a shortcut. A heuristic function, also simply called a heuristic, is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow. For example, it may approximate the exact solution.[2] The objective of a heuristic is to produce a solution in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem at hand. This solution may not be the best of all the solutions to this problem, or it may simply approximate the exact solution. But it is still valuable because finding it does not require a prohibitively long time. Heuristics may produce results by themselves, or they may be used in conjunction with optimization algorithms to improve their efficiency (e.g., they may be used to generate good seed values). Results about NP-hardness in theoretical computer science make heuristics the only viable option for a variety of complex optimization problems that need to be routinely solved in real-world applications. Heuristics underlie the whole field of Artificial Intelligence and the computer simulation of thinking, as they may be used in situations where there are no known algorithms.[3] The trade-off criteria for deciding whether to use a heuristic for solving a given problem include the following: Optimality: When several solutions exist for a given problem, does the heuristic guarantee that the best solution will be found? Is it actually necessary to find the best solution? Completeness: When several solutions exist for a given problem, can the heuristic find them all? Do we actually need all solutions? Many heuristics are only meant to find one solution. Accuracy and precision: Can the heuristic provide a confidence interval for the purported solution? Is the error bar on the solution unreasonably large? Execution time: Is this the best-known heuristic for solving this type of problem? Some heuristics converge faster than others. Some heuristics are only marginally quicker than classic Definition and motivation Trade-off methods, in which case the 'overhead' on calculating the heuristic might have a negative impact. In some cases, it may be difficult to decide whether the solution found by the heuristic is good enough because the theory underlying heuristics is not very elaborate. One way of achieving the computational performance gain expected of a heuristic consists of solving a simpler problem whose solution is also a solution to the initial problem. An example of approximation is described by Jon",1
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Heuristic algorithms are techniques often used in the field of computer science and programming to achieve reasonably good solutions in a reasonable amount of time, especially when dealing with complex problems. In this article, we will discuss how heuristic algorithms utilize programming logic for efficient decision- making. Introduction to Heuristic Algorithms The term heuristic comes from the Greek word heuriskein, which means “to discover.” In the context of programming, heuristic algorithms are designed to solve problems quickly when traditional optimal approaches are impractical in terms of computational time. The primary aim of heuristic algorithms is to produce a “good enough” solution in a “fast enough” time, rather than seeking a perfect solution that requires unrealistic time. Applying Logic in Heuristic Algorithms Heuristic algorithms often involve rule-based or logical approaches to make decisions. Some examples of heuristic algorithms include search algorithms like A* (A-star), which uses logic to prioritize the most likely path to reach the goal at the lowest cost, or Greedy algorithms, which always make the best decision based on the current information. Here are examples of logic application in heuristic algorithms: 1. Greedy Algorithms: The logic in these algorithms is to always select the option that seems best at that moment, hoping that the best local choices will lead to the optimal global solution. In some cases, this approach might not yield the optimal solution, but it usually generates a good enough solution quickly. 2. A (A-star) Algorithms:* This algorithm uses logic to prioritize paths that seem likely to reach the goal with the lowest cost. This logic allows the algorithm to focus on the most promising paths and ignore paths unlikely to yield efficient solutions. Conclusion In programming, the use of heuristic algorithms leverages logic to achieve efficient decisions in a reasonable time. Although the resulting solutions might not be the most optimal, they are typically good enough for most practical applications. Learning and understanding how heuristic algorithms work can help you become a more efficient and effective programmer.",1
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"as fast as possible, without caring about their quality (i.e., number of states visited by the plan). A common method to find plans is via heuristic search. A heuristic is a function h : S →R+ 0 ∪{∞}. It estimates the length of an s-plan for states s ∈S. Heuristic search algorithms start from sI and explore states guided by some heuristic h, preferring states s with low h(s) values. Exam- ples of strong heuristics for agile planning are hadd (Bonet and Geffner 2001), hFF (Hoffmann and Nebel 2001), and hLM(Richter, Helmert, and Westphal 2008). We assume fa- miliarity with common search algorithms such as greedy best-first search (Doran and Michie 1966). Instead of being guided by a heuristic, BFS(w) selects states for expansion based on their novelty, preferring states with low w values (Lipovetzky and Geffner 2012, 2017). The novelty w(s) of a state s is the size of the smallest set of facts F such that s is the first state visited that satisfies F. This simple scheme can be turned into state-of-the- art best-first width search (BFWS) algorithms by extend- ing it with partition functions (Lipovetzky and Geffner 2017; Franc`es et al. 2017, 2018). For BFWS, the novelty w⟨h1,...,hn⟩(s) of a state s given the partition functions ⟨h1, . . . , hn⟩is the size of the smallest set of facts F such that s is the first evaluated state that subsumes F, among all states s′ visited before s for which hi(s) = hi(s′) for 1 ≤i ≤n. In practice, these planners only evaluate novelty up to a bound k, where usually k = 2. If a state s has no novel tuple of size k or less, then w(s) = k + 1. Balancing Exploration and Exploitation One important design choice of a planner is how it balances exploration and exploitation. Exploration techniques search parts of the state space that have not yet been visited. Ex- ploitation techniques prefer going into parts that are consid- ered more promising by some metric. For example, choosing the next expanded state at random is a form of exploration; choosing it based on a heuristic is exploitation. Modern planners usually mix both of them. A common technique is to keep several open-lists during search, each one guided by a different heuristic (R¨oger and Helmert 2010). Some lists are even incomplete since they only re- tain a subset of the generated states, e.g., states generated via preferred operators (Hoffmann and Nebel 2001; Richter and Helmert 2009). The simplest yet most successful method for combining multiple open-lists is alternation (Helmert 2004, 2006). An alternation-based search algorithm main- tains n open-lists, where the i-th open-list is ordered by some heuristic hi. We denote it as [h1, . . . , hn]. The search alternates between the open-lists in a round-robin fashion: first it expands the best state according to h1, adds all suc- cessors to all (or some of the) open-lists, then it expands the best state according to h2, and so on. In iteration n + 1 it expands from h1 again. Alternation is one of the main building",0
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"recently expanded nodes. AlphA* uses the cost function  , where , where λ and Λ are constants with  , π(n) is the parent of n, and ñ is the most recently expanded node. The time complexity of A* depends on the heuristic. In the worst case of an unbounded search space, the number of nodes expanded is exponential in the depth of the solution (the shortest path) d: O(bd), where b is the branching factor (the average number of successors per state).[24] This assumes that a goal state exists at all, and is reachable from the start state; if it is not, and the state space is infinite, the algorithm will not terminate. The heuristic function has a major effect on the practical performance of A* search, since a good heuristic allows A* to prune away many of the bd nodes that an uninformed search would expand. Its quality can be expressed in terms of the effective branching factor b*, which can be determined empirically for a problem instance by measuring the number of nodes generated by expansion, N, and the depth of the solution, then solving[25] Good heuristics are those with low effective branching factor (the optimal being b* = 1). The time complexity is polynomial when the search space is a tree, there is a single goal state, and the heuristic function h meets the following condition: Complexity where h* is the optimal heuristic, the exact cost to get from x to the goal. In other words, the error of h will not grow faster than the logarithm of the ""perfect heuristic"" h* that returns the true distance from x to the goal.[18][24] The space complexity of A* is roughly the same as that of all other graph search algorithms, as it keeps all generated nodes in memory.[1] In practice, this turns out to be the biggest drawback of the A* search, leading to the development of memory-bounded heuristic searches, such as Iterative deepening A*, memory-bounded A*, and SMA*. A* is often used for the common pathfinding problem in applications such as video games, but was originally designed as a general graph traversal algorithm.[4] It finds applications in diverse problems, including the problem of parsing using stochastic grammars in NLP.[26] Other cases include an Informational search with online learning.[27] What sets A* apart from a greedy best-first search algorithm is that it takes the cost/distance already traveled, g(n), into account. Some common variants of Dijkstra's algorithm can be viewed as a special case of A* where the heuristic   for all nodes;[12][13] in turn, both Dijkstra and A* are special cases of dynamic programming.[28] A* itself is a special case of a generalization of branch and bound.[29] A* is similar to beam search except that beam search maintains a limit on the numbers of paths that it has to explore.[30] Anytime A*[31] Block A* D* Field D* Fringe Fringe Saving A* (FSA*) Generalized Adaptive A* (GAA*) Incremental heuristic search Reduced A*[32] Iterative deepening A* (IDA*) Jump point search Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) New",3

What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"A Deep Architecture: Multi-Layer Perceptron Ninad Lunge · Follow 7 min read · Mar 24, 2024 Listen Share More Before beginning with the Perceptron, it is essential that we have some basic understanding about Artificial Neural Networks. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain’s interconnected network of neurons. It consists of interconnected nodes called artificial neurons, organized into layers. Information flows through the network, with each neuron processing input signals and producing an output signal that influences other neurons in the network. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network consisting of multiple layers of neurons. The neurons in the MLP typically use nonlinear activation functions, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in data. MLPs are significant in machine learning because they can learn nonlinear relationships in data, making them powerful models for tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition. Perceptron: Perceptron was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. A Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. This algorithm enables neurons to learn and processes elements in the training set one at a time. A Perceptron Multilayer Perceptron: A multilayer perceptron is a type of feedforward neural network consisting of fully connected neurons with a nonlinear kind of activation function. It is widely used to distinguish data that is not linearly separable. MLPs have been widely used in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition, among others. Their flexibility in architecture and ability to approximate any function under certain conditions make them a fundamental building block in deep learning and neural network research. Some of its key concepts are as follows: Input layer: The input layer consists of nodes or neurons that receive the initial input data. Each neuron represents a feature or dimension of the input data. The number of neurons in the input layer is determined by the dimensionality of the input data. Hidden layer: Between the input and output layers, there can be one or more layers of neurons. Each neuron in a hidden layer receives inputs from all neurons in the previous layer (either the input layer or another hidden layer) and produces an output that is passed to the next layer. The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer are hyperparameters that need to be determined during the model design phase. Output layer: This layer consists of neurons that produce the final output of the network. The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the nature of the task. In binary classification, there may be either one or two neurons depending on the activation function and representing the probability of belonging to one class; while in multi- class classification tasks,",3

For other types deﬁned in this article, there will be more fruitful results. ANN’s theory is just beginning. So ANN is a function approximation. If the human brain is also doing function ap- proximation, then ANN really imitates human well. 1 1 Activation Integral Representation of Functions 1.1 Activation Function The activation function is an important concept in artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), which is thought to be inspired by biological researchs such as cognitive neuroscience. In the mathematical sense, it is understood as mapping with composite function. Indeed, no matter what activation function is, it shows such a characteristic that it “ignores” the almost entire part of the change of function in its deﬁnition domain, while retaining a small part of the function in its deﬁnition domain. Therefore, starting from this idea, the neural network is using the “local reservation” property of so many activation functions to ﬁt a function. It is very similar to calculus, but it is not the case of limit. It suggests that the limit can be taken further and study a “continuous” neural network. But this is not what this section will discuss. This section only demonstrates that a given function can indeed be imitated locally by many activation functions. Later, these activation functions will show a good property, that is, they can be expressed by summation and composition, which is actually the principle of the ANN model. Here it is called the activation integral representation of function. Firstly, the deﬁnition of the activation function is deﬁned. Now the activation functions used in practical applications, such as the famous Sigmoid function, tanh function and so forth, will be considered. They are too special, however, because they are used so frequently, researchers have forgotten the original meaning of the activation function. These functions are only continuous functions that are conducive to gradient calculation[1] in the sense of continuity, which is the original meaning of choosing them. So, back to the original idea, start to analyze an activation function of the original pattern and give it a deﬁnition. Deﬁnition 1.1 The activation function f(x) is monotonic, continuous and deriv- able, satisfying lim x→∞f(x) →ymax and lim x→−∞f(x) →ymin. Here, the reason for not taking the two special values of 0 and 1 is that they have no special meaning in mathematics, they cater more to biological concepts and even just make people feel “comfortable”. In fact, in the next analysis, it will be found that this is not necessary and even for convenience, and it will be conceptualized to some extent. In short, the core idea of activation functions is to imitate only a small range of deﬁne domain of a function. In the following analysis, in order to simplify the discussion of the problem, a simple activation function is constructed. Its",1

What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"What is Perceptron: A BeginnersTutorial For Perceptron Antony Christopher · Follow 5 min read · May 16, 2021 Listen Share More Perceptron algorithm used in supervised machine learning for classification. There are two types of classification. One will classify the data by drawing a straight line called a linear binary classifier. Another will be cannot classify the data by drawing the straight line called a non-linear binary classifier. Artificial Neuron In Today’s world time is going fast with the same phase of invention too. The AI solution gives a new platform for machines to think like the human brain. The ANN plays a vital role here basically, it functions the same way how the biological neurons work for humans. To make it a simple context, ANN holds two or more input with weighted values and merge them with mathematical function to produce output. Let see how the biological neurons work. Biological Neuron The neuron is the most important function in our human brain. When we sense some activity from the outside the signal is passed to neurons. Once the signal is received from the neuron, produces the respective output. The output is received back to activity as a response. Perceptron The block diagram illustrates the sequence of input as X1, X2, …Xn with their weights as W1, W2…..Wn. Further, calculate the sum of the weights by applying W1*X1+W2*X2+…Wn*Xn. Finally passed the sum of the weights to the activation function. From the function produces the output. Activation Function The activation function is decision-making for neural networks. This function produces a binary output. That’s the reason it’s called a binary step function. The threshold value gets introduced here by validating the value from the weighted sum. If the value is > 0, then applied classification as 1 or True. If the value is < 0, then applied classification as 0 or False. Bias Bias allows you to shift the activation function by adding a constant (i.e. the given bias) to the input. Bias in Neural Networks can be thought of as analogous to the role of a constant in a linear function, whereby the line is effectively transposed by the constant value. In a scenario with bias, the input to the activation function is ‘x’ times the connection weight ‘w0’ plus the bias times the connection weight for the bias ‘w1’. This has the effect of shifting the activation function by a constant amount (b * w1). With all the explanations, I would explain in better understanding in the real-world scenario.
