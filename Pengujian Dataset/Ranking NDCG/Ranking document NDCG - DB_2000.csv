What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"Attendance you can train the machine with inputs of your biometric identity — it can be your thumb, iris or ear-lobe, etc. Once the machine is trained it can validate your future input and can easily identify you. Understanding Unsupervised Learning So, what is Unsupervised Learning? Mathematically, Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data. Let me rephrase it for you in simple terms: In the unsupervised learning approach, the sample of a training dataset does not have an expected output associated with them. Using the unsupervised learning algorithms you can detect patterns based on the typical characteristics of the input data. Clustering can be considered as an example of a machine learning task that uses the unsupervised learning approach. The machine then groups similar data samples and identify different clusters within the data. Now let me tell you why this category of machine learning is known as unsupervised learning? Well, this category of machine learning is known as unsupervised because unlike supervised learning there is no teacher. Algorithms are left on their own to discover and return the interesting structure in the data. Unsupervised Learning Usecases A friend invites you to his party where you meet totally strangers. Now you will classify them using unsupervised learning (no prior knowledge) and this classification can be on the basis of gender, age group, dressing, educational qualification or whatever way you would like. Since you didn’t have any prior knowledge about people and so you just classified them “on-the-go”. Let’s suppose you have never seen a Football match before and by chance watch a video on the internet, now you can classify players on the basis of different criterion like Players wearing the same sort of kits are in one class, Players ",3
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is simply the strategy of making a machine learn from data. When going deep, we can say that Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers the ability to learn and improve on their own experience without being explicitly programmed. Mainly there are three types of methods in which machine learning algorithms learn. They are… Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning Reinforcement Learning In a supervised learning process, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions called the labels. This means, there are already some data that consist of the desired answers or output in the dataset itself. Let’s understand the concept of supervised learning with an example, take the case of a five-year-old student, he/she is not likely to understand the subjects without the help of his/her teacher. So there he/she needs a supervisor for learning the subjects. In the same way, our supervised learning algorithm is also like a five-year-old child which cannot learn without the help of a supervisor. So to make a model more Supervised Learning efficient, we need to train them continuously with the labeled training data to yield a good result. After the algorithm learns the rules and patterns of the data, it creates a model which is an algorithmic equation for producing output data with the rules and patterns derived from training data. Here we are giving all labels to the algorithm to predict the outcome. Once the algorithm is well trained with the data it can be launched in the real world. important supervised learning algorithms: Linear Regression Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines(SVM) k-Nearest Neighbors Decision Tree & Random Forests Neural Networks Supervised Learning Model Unsupervised Learning Important Unsupervised Learning algorithms Important Unsupervised learning algorithms: Clustering K-Means DBSCAN Hierarchical Cluster Analysis(HCA) Anomaly detection and",1
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"where to start. By being unsupervised in a laissez-faire teaching style, you start from a clean slate with less bias and may even find a new, better way solve a problem. Therefore, this is why unsupervised learning is also known as knowledge discovery. Unsupervised learning is very useful when conducting exploratory data analysis. To find the interesting structures in unlabeled data, we use density estimation. The most common form of which is clustering. Among others, there is also dimensionality reduction, latent variable models and anomaly detection. More complex unsupervised techniques involve neural networks like Auto-encoders and Deep Belief Networks, but we won’t go into them in this introduction blog. Clustering Unsupervised learning is mostly used for clustering. Clustering is the act of creating groups with differing characteristics. Clustering attempts to find various subgroups within a dataset. As this is unsupervised learning, we are not restricted to any set of labels and are free to choose how many clusters to create. This is both a blessing and a curse. Picking a model that has the correct number of clusters (complexity) has to be conducted via an empirical model selection process. Association In Association Learning you want to uncover the rules that describe your data. For example, if a person watches video A they will likely watch video B. Association rules are perfect for examples such as this where you want to find related items. Anomaly Detection The identification of rare or unusual items that differ from the majority of data. For example, your bank will use this to detect fraudulent activity on your card. Your normal spending habits will fall within a normal range of behaviors and values. But when someone tries to steal from you using your card the behavior will be different from your normal pattern. Anomaly detection uses unsupervised learning to separate and detect these strange occurrences. Dimensionality Reduction Dimensionality reduction",1

Regression Like classification, regression is also about inputs and corresponding outputs. But outputs for classification are typically discrete types (cat, dog), outputs for regression are a general number. In other words, it’s not a 0 or 1, but a sliding scale of possibility. For example, given a radiological image, a model could predict how many more years the associated individual will be sick or healthy. In unsupervised learning, the machine learns from data for which the outcomes are not known. It’s given input samples, but no output samples. Unsupervised Learning 5/24 For instance, imagine you have a set of documents that you would like to organize. For example, some documents may be about sports, others about history, and still others about the arts. Given only the set of documents, the objective is to automatically learn how to cluster them into types. For clustering, only the input (the data one seeks to organize) is provided in the sample data. No explicit output is provided. The model may cluster the sports documents in one group and the history documents in another, but it was never told explicitly what a sports or history document looked like, as it was never shown sample output data. In fact, once clustering is complete, the model still won’t know what a sports or history document is. All the model “knows” is that inputs in Group A are similar to each other, as are the inputs in Group B. It’s for humans to look at the clusters and decide whether and how they make sense. Unsupervised learning is less common in practical business settings, but it is attractive: you don’t need labeled data and can avoid the human effort and cost of doing so. Unsupervised learning is potentially applicable in many more areas, since it’s not narrowly restricted to applications with labeled data.

In our training data, we don’t provide any label to the corresponding data. The unsupervised model is able to separate both the characters by looking at the type of data and models the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about it. Types of Unsupervised Machine Learning :- Reinforcement Machine Learning: -Reinforcement learning is a type of dynamic programming where an agent learns by interacting with its environment. -The agent receives rewards for performing correctly and penalties for performing incorrectly. Without intervention from a human, the agent learns to maximize its reward and minimize its penalty. -This training method relies on a system of reward and punishment to teach algorithms.

Traditional methods present a very  restrictive range of applications, mainly limited by the features  of the function to be optimized and of the constraint functions.  In contrast, evolutionary algorithms present almost no  restriction to the features of these functions, although the most  appropriate constraint-handling technique is still an open  question. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is  sometimes viewed as another evolutionary algorithm because  of their many similarities, despite not being inspired by the  same metaphor. Namely, they evolve a population of  individuals taking into consideration previous experiences and  using stochastic operators to introduce new responses. The  advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to  traditional methods have been greatly discussed in the  literature for decades. While all such advantages are valid  when comparing the PSO paradigm to traditional methods, its  main advantages with respect to evolutionary algorithms  consist of its noticeably lower computational cost and easier  implementation.

What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"A particle swarm searching for the global minimum of a function Particle swarm optimization In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO)[1] is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search- space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions. PSO is originally attributed to Kennedy, Eberhart and Shi[2][3] and was first intended for simulating social behaviour,[4] as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The book by Kennedy and Eberhart[5] describes many philosophical aspects of PSO and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of PSO applications is made by Poli.[6][7] In 2017, a comprehensive review on theoretical and experimental works on PSO has been published by Bonyadi and Michalewicz.[1] PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. Also, PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi- newton methods. However, metaheuristics such as PSO do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found. A basic variant of the PSO algorithm works by having a population (called a swarm) of candidate solutions (called",1

May 22, 2024 Abstract General purpose optimization routines such as nlminb, optim (R) or nlmixed (SAS) are frequently used to estimate model parameters in nonstandard distributions. This paper presents Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), as an alternative to many of the current algorithms used in statistics. We find that PSO can not only reproduce the same results as the above routines, it can also produce results that are more optimal or when others cannot converge. In the latter case, it can also identify the source of the problem or problems. We highlight advantages of using PSO using four examples, where: (1) some parameters in a generalized distribution are unidentified using PSO when it is not apparent or computationally manifested using routines in R or SAS; (2) PSO can produce estimation results for the log-binomial regressions when current routines may not; (3) PSO provides flexibility in the link function for binomial regression with LASSO penalty, which is unsupported by standard packages like GLM and GENMOD in Stata and SAS, respectively, and (4) PSO provides superior MLE estimates for an EE-IW distribution compared with those from the traditional statistical methods that rely on moments.

Particle Swarm Optimization    Kennedy and Eberhart developed Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in 1995, borrowing  inspiration from natural processes like bird flocking and fish schooling[12]. This strategy is used  to solve optimization problems ranging from simple single-objective concerns to sophisticated  multi-objective scenarios.

It is frequently used in  domains such as engineering, economics, and computer science for a number of applications,  including neural network training, function minimization, and product optimization[14][15][37].  The core mechanism of PSO is a set of potential solutions, known as particles, that navigate  across a solution space. These particles move according to mathematical rules that govern their  location and velocity, taking into account both their personal best positions and the best positions  discovered by the swarm. This dual impact directs the entire swarm toward optimal solutions via  iterative changes. PSO's capacity to iteratively search for superior solutions while exploiting the  swarm's collective learning makes it an effective tool for optimization problems.

How is AI used in everyday life?,"AI can be categorized into two main types: 1. Narrow AI (or Weak AI): This type of AI is programmed to perform a narrow task like facial recognition, internet searches, or driving a car. Most of the AI encountered in day-to-day life, from chatbots to virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, falls under this category. Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a frontier in computer science, aiming to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. In essence, AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It’s related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to biologically observable methods. Defining AI The definition of AI is often a topic of debate, but at its core, it involves machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include planning, understanding language, recognizing objects and sounds, learning, and problem solving. We can consider AI to be a system that perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Brief History of AI AI as a concept has been around for centuries, with roots in Greek mythology. Modern AI, however, began in the 20th century with the development of the Turing Test by Alan Turing, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called “intelligent.” The field of AI research was formally founded at a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956.

As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, ethical considerations are increasingly important. Issues like privacy, security, and the potential impact on employment are significant topics of discussion. Ensuring that AI benefits society while minimizing its risks is a challenge that needs ongoing attention. The Future of AI The future of AI promises advancements in various fields and the potential to solve complex global challenges. However, it also poses significant challenges and risks that need to be managed responsibly. Various technologies are used in AI, including: 1. Machine Learning: Allowing machines to learn from data. 2. Natural Language Processing: Enabling machines to understand and interact with human language. 3. Robotics: The field of creating robots that can perform tasks in the physical world. 4. Neural Networks: Computer systems modeled on the human brain and nervous system.

What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Heuristic algorithms are techniques often used in the field of computer science and programming to achieve reasonably good solutions in a reasonable amount of time, especially when dealing with complex problems. In this article, we will discuss how heuristic algorithms utilize programming logic for efficient decision- making. Introduction to Heuristic Algorithms The term heuristic comes from the Greek word heuriskein, which means “to discover.” In the context of programming, heuristic algorithms are designed to solve problems quickly when traditional optimal approaches are impractical in terms of computational time. The primary aim of heuristic algorithms is to produce a “good enough” solution in a “fast enough” time, rather than seeking a perfect solution that requires unrealistic time. Applying Logic in Heuristic Algorithms Heuristic algorithms often involve rule-based or logical approaches to make decisions. Some examples of heuristic algorithms include search algorithms like A* (A-star), which uses logic to prioritize the most likely path to reach the goal at the lowest cost, or Greedy algorithms, which always make the best decision based on the current information. Here are examples of logic application in heuristic algorithms: 1. Greedy Algorithms: The logic in these algorithms is to always select the option that seems best at that moment, hoping that the best local choices will lead to the optimal global solution. In some cases, this approach might not yield the optimal solution, but it usually generates a good enough solution quickly. 2. A (A-star) Algorithms:* This algorithm uses logic to prioritize paths that seem likely to reach the goal with the lowest cost. This logic allows the algorithm to focus on the most promising paths and ignore paths unlikely to yield efficient solutions. Conclusion In programming, the use of heuristic algorithms leverages logic to achieve efficient decisions in a reasonable time. Although the resulting solutions might not be",2
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Heuristic (computer science) In mathematical optimization and computer science, heuristic (from Greek εὑρίσκω ""I find, discover""[1]) is a technique designed for problem solving more quickly when classic methods are too slow for finding an exact or approximate solution, or when classic methods fail to find any exact solution in a search space. This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for speed. In a way, it can be considered a shortcut. A heuristic function, also simply called a heuristic, is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow. For example, it may approximate the exact solution.[2] The objective of a heuristic is to produce a solution in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem at hand. This solution may not be the best of all the solutions to this problem, or it may simply approximate the exact solution. But it is still valuable because finding it does not require a prohibitively long time. Heuristics may produce results by themselves, or they may be used in conjunction with optimization algorithms to improve their efficiency (e.g., they may be used to generate good seed values). Results about NP-hardness in theoretical computer science make heuristics the only viable option for a variety of complex optimization problems that need to be routinely solved in real-world applications. Heuristics underlie the whole field of Artificial Intelligence and the computer simulation of thinking, as they may be used in situations where there are no known algorithms.[3] The trade-off criteria for deciding whether to use a heuristic for solving a given problem include the following: Optimality: When several solutions exist for a given problem, does the heuristic guarantee that the best solution will be found? Is it actually necessary to find the best solution? Completeness: When several solutions exist for a given",2
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"[7]. Both [7] and [20] claim success from their experiments, but [20] failed to explain their results in a way that is comparable to other research. Both papers ran experiments using the dataset from [21]. Reference [20] did provide source code, so we recreated their results. E. Metaheuristic Optimization Using a heuristic algorithm can often lead to a ”good enough” solution to the CVRP, and heuristics can usually find that solution quickly. What is gained in solution completion time could be improved in solution quality. In the transporta- tion industry, companies have often found that getting close quickly can still be helpful when making a recommendation. These recommendations would be provided to a logistic plan- ner, who may manually adjust the solution before generating the final load plan for the routes. Generally, the transportation industry is willing to make this trade-off as long as they know their recommendation systems are creating a near-optimal solution. Many heuristics have been providing solutions that make this trade-off for a long time. Clark and Wright’s 1964 savings algorithm [3], while perhaps the oldest heuristic for the CVRP, is still one of the fastest and is capable of obtaining near-optimal solutions for some problems. References [22] and [23] are also well-known heuristics for the CVRP, and we report our results compared to all three of these algorithms. Is there an alternative to heuristics that can provide better solutions? What other options exist to solve the CVRP? Metaheuristics are algorithms that combine search algorithms to find better solutions across the space of all solutions. Usually they use a combination of different heuristics to create neighborhoods within the search space to perform local search then on. There are many different types of metaheuristics and many different ways to categorize them. Famous examples include the genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization, and simulated annealing. As stated in [24], a type of",1
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"cases).[4] Another example of heuristic making an algorithm faster occurs in certain search problems. Initially, the heuristic tries every possibility at each step, like the full-space search algorithm. But it can stop the search at any time if the current possibility is already worse than the best solution already found. In such search problems, a heuristic can be used to try good choices first so that bad paths can be eliminated early (see alpha–beta pruning). In the case of best-first search algorithms, such as A* search, the heuristic improves the algorithm's convergence while maintaining its correctness as long as the heuristic is admissible. In their Turing Award acceptance speech, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon discuss the heuristic search hypothesis: a physical symbol system will repeatedly generate and modify known symbol structures until the created structure matches the solution structure. Each following step depends upon the step before it, thus the heuristic search learns what avenues to pursue and which ones to disregard by measuring how close the current step is to the solution. Therefore, some possibilities will never be generated as they are measured to be less likely to complete the solution. Examples Simpler problem Travelling salesman problem Search Newell and Simon: heuristic search hypothesis A heuristic method can accomplish its task by using search trees. However, instead of generating all possible solution branches, a heuristic selects branches more likely to produce outcomes than other branches. It is selective at each decision point, picking branches that are more likely to produce solutions.[5] Antivirus software often uses heuristic rules for detecting viruses and other forms of malware. Heuristic scanning looks for code and/or behavioral patterns common to a class or family of viruses, with different sets of rules for different viruses.

Some common variants of Dijkstra's algorithm can be viewed as a special case of A* where the heuristic   for all nodes;[12][13] in turn, both Dijkstra and A* are special cases of dynamic programming.[28] A* itself is a special case of a generalization of branch and bound.[29] A* is similar to beam search except that beam search maintains a limit on the numbers of paths that it has to explore.[30] Anytime A*[31] Block A* D* Field D* Fringe Fringe Saving A* (FSA*) Generalized Adaptive A* (GAA*) Incremental heuristic search Reduced A*[32] Iterative deepening A* (IDA*) Jump point search Lifelong Planning A* (LPA*) New Bidirectional A* (NBA*)[33] Applications Relations to other algorithms Variants Simplified Memory bounded A* (SMA*) Theta* A* can also be adapted to a bidirectional search algorithm, but special care needs to be taken for the stopping criterion.[34] Any-angle path planning, search for paths that are not limited to moving along graph edges but rather can take on any angle Breadth-first search Depth-first search Dijkstra's algorithm – Algorithm for finding shortest paths a. “A*-like” means the algorithm searches by extending paths originating at the start node one edge at a time, just as A* does.

What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"A Deep Architecture: Multi-Layer Perceptron Ninad Lunge · Follow 7 min read · Mar 24, 2024 Listen Share More Before beginning with the Perceptron, it is essential that we have some basic understanding about Artificial Neural Networks. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain’s interconnected network of neurons. It consists of interconnected nodes called artificial neurons, organized into layers. Information flows through the network, with each neuron processing input signals and producing an output signal that influences other neurons in the network. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network consisting of multiple layers of neurons. The neurons in the MLP typically use nonlinear activation functions, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in data. MLPs are significant in machine learning because they can learn nonlinear relationships in data, making them powerful models for tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition. Perceptron: Perceptron was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. A Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. This algorithm enables neurons to learn and processes elements in the training set one at a time. A Perceptron Multilayer Perceptron: A multilayer perceptron is a type of feedforward neural network consisting of fully connected neurons with a nonlinear kind of activation function. It is widely used to distinguish data that is not linearly separable. MLPs have been widely used in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition, among others. Their flexibility in architecture and ability to approximate any function under certain conditions make them a fundamental building block in deep learning and neural network research. Some of its key concepts are as follows: Input layer: The input layer consists of nodes or neurons that",3
What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"classification, image restoration, and many  more. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a set of neurons.  It is comprised of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output  layer. In ANN, the computation of any neuron is divided into  two parts. In the first part, the input value is multiplied by a  weighted value. Further, in the second part, the decision is  made by the activation function based on some threshold  value, which defines whether the neurons should fire or not  (Apicella et al., 2021). It utilizes these three layers and  discovers patterns between input and output with accuracy. To  find the pattern, the activation function plays an important role  by activating neurons (Gustineli, 2022).  The simplest activation function is the linear AF. An AF  plays a very important role in finding a non-linear relationship.  Tangent and Sigmoid, ReLU are the most commonly used AF.  Some basic properties AF should have are:   1.1 Property of AF  Non-linearity: Activation functions play a vital role in  dealing with linearity. In the absence of activation function, the  data would only move through the network's nodes and layers  using linear functions. Irrespective of the number of layers the  output is always the result of a linear function reason being the  composite of these linear functions also results in a linear  function.  Computational cost: Computation of AF should not be  complex (Apicella et al., 2021).   Differentiability: Differentiability relates to a function,  which is differentiable at every point in a specific domain. A  differentiable function can easily calculate the gradient and  optimized neuron’s weight. A difficult AF will decrease the  speed of computation (Maniatopoulos & Mitianoudis, 2021).  Vanishing Gradient: Vanishing gradient problem is one of  the major issues, which caused the loss of information during  back-propagation. AF should not have a vanishing gradient  problem.  Saturation: Saturation is a term that describes the issue",3

They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming. An ANN is based on a collection of connected  units  called  artificial neurons,  (analogous  to  biological neurons in a biological brain). Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers, typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream. Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. Neural networks The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information. Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing ""Go""[144]).

There are two types of classification. One will classify the data by drawing a straight line called a linear binary classifier. Another will be cannot classify the data by drawing the straight line called a non-linear binary classifier. Artificial Neuron In Today’s world time is going fast with the same phase of invention too. The AI solution gives a new platform for machines to think like the human brain. The ANN plays a vital role here basically, it functions the same way how the biological neurons work for humans. To make it a simple context, ANN holds two or more input with weighted values and merge them with mathematical function to produce output. Let see how the biological neurons work. Biological Neuron The neuron is the most important function in our human brain. When we sense some activity from the outside the signal is passed to neurons. Once the signal is received from the neuron, produces the respective output. The output is received back to activity as a response. Perceptron The block diagram illustrates the sequence of input as X1, X2, …Xn with their weights as W1, W2…..Wn. Further, calculate the sum of the weights by applying W1*X1+W2*X2+…Wn*Xn. Finally passed the sum of the weights to the activation function. From the function produces the output. Activation Function The activation function is decision-making for neural networks. This function produces a binary output. That’s the reason it’s called a binary step function. The threshold value gets introduced here by validating the value from the weighted sum. If the value is > 0, then applied classification as 1 or True. If the value is < 0, then applied classification as 0 or False. Bias Bias allows you to shift the activation function by adding a constant (i.e. the given bias) to the input. Bias in",2
