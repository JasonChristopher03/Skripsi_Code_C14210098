What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"Let’s break down three key types of machine learning in a way that’s easy to follow. Unsupervised learning is when the computer doesn’t get any labels. It’s like being given a set of puzzles with no instructions. The computer’s job is to find patterns and group similar things together. For example, it might look at a bunch of animal photos and group them based on common traits, even if it doesn’t know the names. The great thing about this approach is that it’s perfect for discovering hidden patterns. The downside? The computer might group things in ways that don’t always make sense to us. Supervised learning is like learning with a teacher who gives you both questions and answers. Imagine showing a computer a bunch of images labeled “cat” or “dog.” The machine looks for patterns, learning what makes each animal unique. Over time, it can predict whether new pictures show cats or dogs, based on the patterns it’s seen. The big advantage? It’s fast because the computer has clear guidance. The downside? You need a lot of labeled data, which can take time to prepare. Reinforcement learning is more like a game. The computer learns by trying actions and receiving feedback — rewards for good choices, penalties for mistakes. Think of training a robot to navigate a maze. It tries different paths, and each time it hits a wall, it learns to avoid that route next time. The benefit here is that it can learn complex tasks over time. The challenge? It takes a lot of trial and error for the computer to figure out the best approach. Supervised Learning: Guided Learning with Answers Reinforcement Learning: Learning by Trying and Failing Unsupervised Learning: Figuring Things Out on Your Own Now you see how these different approaches make machines smarter. From helping us find better movie recommendations to improving game AI, machine learning is part of our everyday lives. What’s a piece of technology that has impressed you recently with how smart it seems? I’d love to hear about it!",3
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is simply the strategy of making a machine learn from data. When going deep, we can say that Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers the ability to learn and improve on their own experience without being explicitly programmed. Mainly there are three types of methods in which machine learning algorithms learn. They are… Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning Reinforcement Learning In a supervised learning process, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions called the labels. This means, there are already some data that consist of the desired answers or output in the dataset itself. Let’s understand the concept of supervised learning with an example, take the case of a five-year-old student, he/she is not likely to understand the subjects without the help of his/her teacher. So there he/she needs a supervisor for learning the subjects. In the same way, our supervised learning algorithm is also like a five-year-old child which cannot learn without the help of a supervisor. So to make a model more Supervised Learning efficient, we need to train them continuously with the labeled training data to yield a good result. After the algorithm learns the rules and patterns of the data, it creates a model which is an algorithmic equation for producing output data with the rules and patterns derived from training data. Here we are giving all labels to the algorithm to predict the outcome. Once the algorithm is well trained with the data it can be launched in the real world. important supervised learning algorithms: Linear Regression Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines(SVM) k-Nearest Neighbors Decision Tree & Random Forests Neural Networks Supervised Learning Model Unsupervised Learning Important Unsupervised Learning algorithms Important Unsupervised learning algorithms: Clustering K-Means DBSCAN Hierarchical Cluster Analysis(HCA) Anomaly detection and novelty detection One-class-SVM Isolation Forest In unsupervised learning, the data patterns are not classified. Instead, the algorithm tries to uncover the hidden patterns in a dataset and create labels. This means the unsupervised learning algorithms are able to classify the overall data into groups of data that are quite similar in their features. Suppose you want to identify which type of customers are mostly attracted to your products, you can classify them into different groups using unsupervised learning algorithms based on their purchasing behavior and can identify which type of customers are most attracted to your product. In industry, unsupervised learning is particularly powerful in fraud detection where the most dangerous attacks are often those yet to be classified. Moreover, it is used in spam filtering, fraudulent transactions, fraudulent online activities, etc. Unsupervised Learning Model Association rule learning Apriori Eclat Visualization and dimensionality reduction Principal Component Analysis(PCA) Kernal PCA Locally-Linear Embedding(LLE) t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding(t-SNE) Reinforcement Learning One of the most advanced learning approaches in Machine Learning is Reinforcement learning. Unlike supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning is a sophisticated learning technique that continuously improves its model by leveraging feedback from previous iterations. The learning system is called an agent which gets rewards for good performance and penalties for bad performance. At each time the machine can understand which type of strategy is the best fit to get the rewards and to keep away from penalties. The method of reinforcement learning is used to train robots how to walk, jump, run, etc. Conclusion Supervised and Unsupervised learning is mostly used in industries to build smart systems. Moreover, these algorithms can also be used to create insights on data that are quite useful for data scientists when working on large datasets. Reinforcement learning on the other hand is used mostly in the field of robotics.",2
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"of our neighbors are members of that class. This classification can be accomplished with simple majority vote or distance-weighted voting [10]. B. Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning deals with input data that are not labeled at all. The input is unsorted information or data and we do not have any idea, clue or guidance about the input characteristics and features. In this case, grouping can be processed based on the shape, differences, similarities and different patterns of the data. In terms of complexity, it is a computationally complex model. Unlike supervised learning, the number of classes is unknown. Unsupervised learning can be used for clustering, feature learning, anomaly detection, Fig. 4. Overview of the KNN algorithm, outlining the steps involved in categorizing an unclassified data point based on majority voting from its nearest neighbors [11]. and dimensionality reduction [6]. Clustering is one of the important types of un-supervised machine learning algorithms which group and categorize unlabeled data. It is similar to classification, but the only difference is in the dataset. In classification we are dealing with labeled data but in clus- tering we are working with un-labeled dataset. To provide a clearer understanding of this concept, the general framework of clustering is shown in Fig. 7 (b). K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm which is working based on randomly initializing the centroids, computing the distances among given data points and centroids, and assigning the sample points to the new clusters. The main steps of the k-means clustering are depicted in Fig. 5 [12]. Fig. 5. Key steps of the K-Means clustering algorithm, illustrating the process of grouping data points into distinct clusters based on their features. In Fig. 6, we try to find the best place to separate the image after filtering with k-means clustering method. The images have been collected from Kaggle [13]. In this method as briefly 4 described in [14], we can use the final image in the form of a matrix. We select several random starting points in the matrix. Using the k-means method, we divide the points inside the image into several clusters [14]. The center point of each cluster can also be considered as the center of each character. Fig. 6. Samples of segmentations based on k-means clustering C. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning (RL) is another subset of machine learning in which the agents are allowed to learn from their own experiences and errors in an environment leading to maximized total cumulative reward and making a balance between exploration and exploitation which are the main goals of RL [15]. As it is mentioned above, the main aim of unsuper- vised learning is to deal with unsorted data, differences, and similarities among them. Also, the main target in supervised learning is dealing with labeled data for better prediction and classification. The framework of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are depicted in Fig. 7. D. Semi-supervised Learning Some drawbacks in supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms like manually labeling the data and limited spec- trum of applications, respectively [16] are the main motiva- tions of developing semi-supervised learning. In this type of learning, we are dealing with both labeled and unlabeled data. As seen in Fig. 8, the initial step here is clustering based on the similarity in the input data. It means that unsupervised learning is used first to cluster similar data and use it to train the model. Then this information can be used to label the remaining unlabeled data [6]. This process is called pseudo-labeling. Next, train the model based on these combined labeled and pseudo-labeled data [6][16] which results in prediction with better accuracy. E. Federated Learning Federated Learning (FL) offers a revolutionary training strategy for creating individualized models while preserving user privacy [17] [18]. With the introduction of artificial intelligence chipsets, client devices’ processing resources have increased, gradually shifting model training from a central server to terminal devices. Additionally, this approach provides a privacy protection mechanism that leverages the processing capabilities of terminal devices to train models, preventing pri- vate information from being leaked during data transmission. It also fully utilizes the vast dataset resources available from smartphones and other devices [17]. Notably, we demonstrated how federate learning operates in Fig. 9, where several models are trained on various data sources while preserving security [19]. It is demonstrated that each model is trained locally on the relevant data source, and after that, it sends its updated parameters to a central Fig. 7. Illustrative frameworks of different machine learning paradigms: (a) supervised learning [16], which uses labeled data for training; (b) unsupervised learning [16], which aims to find patterns from unlabeled data; and (c) reinforcement learning [6], where an agent interacts with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards. Fig. 8. Overview of the main steps in semi-supervised learning [6]. server, which aggregates them to create a global model. After that, the individual models receive further training from this global model, which enhances their functionality and ability to generalize. This collaborative learning is made possible through this iterative technique without disclosing private information. Additionally, a major function of this training paradigm is to ensure user privacy, distinguishing it significantly from typical 5 privacy protection techniques used in big data, such as differ- ential privacy and k-anonymity; moreover, federated learning primarily safeguards privacy by transmitting encrypted pro- cessing parameters, preventing attackers from obtaining source data. These measures ensure data-level privacy and compliance with the General Data",1
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"Machine Learning (ML) is a fascinating field that empowers computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. Python, with its simplicity and extensive libraries, has become the go- to language for many machine learning enthusiasts and professionals. In this blog, we’ll delve into the fundamentals of machine learning and how Python is instrumental in implementing and deploying ML models. Understanding Machine Learning At its core, machine learning is about creating algorithms and models that enable computers to learn patterns from data. There are three main types of machine learning: 1. Supervised Learning: The algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, where the input data is paired with the corresponding output. The model learns to map inputs to outputs and can then make predictions on new, unseen data. 2. Unsupervised Learning: Here, the algorithm is given unlabeled data and is tasked with finding patterns or structures within it. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common tasks in unsupervised learning. 3. Reinforcement Learning: This involves training a model to make sequences of decisions. The model receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on the actions it takes, allowing it to learn the best course of action over time. Python and Machine Learning Python’s popularity in the machine learning community can be attributed to several factors: 1. Libraries and Frameworks: Python boasts a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks specifically designed for machine learning. Some of the most prominent ones include: Scikit-learn: A comprehensive library for classical machine learning algorithms. TensorFlow and PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks widely used for building and training neural networks. Pandas: Ideal for data manipulation and analysis. NumPy: Essential for numerical operations and handling arrays. M 2. Ease of Use: Python’s syntax is clean and readable, making it accessible for beginners. This ease of use accelerates the development and implementation of machine learning solutions. 3. Community Support: The Python community is vast and active, with a wealth of resources, forums, and documentation available. This support is invaluable for individuals seeking help or sharing insights. Getting Started with Python for Machine Learning 1. Install Python and Libraries If you don’t have Python installed, download and install the latest version from the official Python website. Once installed, you can use the package manager pip  to install libraries. For example: pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy 2. Learn the Basics Familiarize yourself with Python basics, data types, and control structures. Understanding concepts like lists, dictionaries, loops, and functions is crucial. For that you can read my previous blog posts on my profile. 3. Explore Datasets Start by exploring datasets relevant to your interests. Kaggle  is an excellent platform for finding diverse datasets suitable for various machine learning tasks. 4. Learn Scikit-learn Scikit-learn is an excellent starting point for beginners. Learn how to import datasets, preprocess data, and apply machine learning algorithms. Here’s a simple example of using Scikit-learn for linear regression: from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error import pandas as pd # Load dataset data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv') # Split data into features and target variable X = data.drop('target_variable', axis=1) y = data['target_variable'] # Split data into training and testing sets X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random # Create a linear regression model model = LinearRegression() # Train the model model.fit(X_train, y_train) # Make predictions y_pred = model.predict(X_test) # Evaluate the model mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred) print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}') 5. Dive into Deep Learning Once you’re comfortable with the basics, explore deep learning using TensorFlow or PyTorch. These frameworks provide tools for building and training neural networks. Start with simple examples and gradually work your way up to more complex architectures. Conclusion Machine learning with Python is an exciting journey that opens up endless possibilities for solving real-world problems. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer, Python’s versatility and the expansive machine learning ecosystem make it a powerful choice for turning data into actionable insights.

What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"learning is also known as knowledge discovery. Unsupervised learning is very useful when conducting exploratory data analysis. To find the interesting structures in unlabeled data, we use density estimation. The most common form of which is clustering. Among others, there is also dimensionality reduction, latent variable models and anomaly detection. More complex unsupervised techniques involve neural networks like Auto-encoders and Deep Belief Networks, but we won’t go into them in this introduction blog. Clustering Unsupervised learning is mostly used for clustering. Clustering is the act of creating groups with differing characteristics. Clustering attempts to find various subgroups within a dataset. As this is unsupervised learning, we are not restricted to any set of labels and are free to choose how many clusters to create. This is both a blessing and a curse. Picking a model that has the correct number of clusters (complexity) has to be conducted via an empirical model selection process. Association In Association Learning you want to uncover the rules that describe your data. For example, if a person watches video A they will likely watch video B. Association rules are perfect for examples such as this where you want to find related items. Anomaly Detection The identification of rare or unusual items that differ from the majority of data. For example, your bank will use this to detect fraudulent activity on your card. Your normal spending habits will fall within a normal range of behaviors and values. But when someone tries to steal from you using your card the behavior will be different from your normal pattern. Anomaly detection uses unsupervised learning to separate and detect these strange occurrences. Dimensionality Reduction Dimensionality reduction aims to find the most important features to reduce the original feature set down into a smaller more efficient set that still encodes the important data. For example, in predicting the number of visitors to the beach we might use the temperature, day of the week, month and number of events scheduled for that day as inputs. But the month might actually be not important for predicting the number of visitors. Irrelevant features such as this can confuse a Machine Leaning algorithms and make them less efficient and accurate. By using dimensionality reduction, only the most important features are identified and used. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used technique. Examples In the real world, clustering has successfully been used to discover a new type of star by investigating what sub groups of star automatically form based on the stars characteristics. In marketing, it is regularly used to cluster customers into similar groups based on their behaviors and characteristics. Association learning is used for recommending or finding related items. A common example is market basket analysis. In market basket analysis, association rules are found to predict other items a customer is likely to buy based on what they have placed in their basket. Amazon use this. If you place a new laptop in your basket, they recommend items like a laptop case via their association rules. Anomaly detection is well suited in scenarios such as fraud detection and malware detection. Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning is a mix between supervised and unsupervised approaches. The learning process isn’t closely supervised with example outputs for every single input, but we also don’t let the algorithm do its own thing and provide no form of feedback. Semi-supervised learning takes the middle road. By being able to mix together a small amount of labelled data with a much larger unlabeled dataset it reduces the burden of having enough labelled data. Therefore, it opens up many more problems to be solved with machine learning. Generative Adversarial Networks Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been a recent breakthrough with incredible results. GANs use two neural networks, a generator and discriminator. The generator generates output and the discriminator critiques it. By battling against each other they both become increasingly skilled. By using a network to both generate input and another one to generate outputs there is no need for us to provide explicit labels every single time and so it can be classed as semi-supervised. Examples A perfect example is in medical scans, such as breast cancer scans. A trained expert is needed to label these which is time consuming and very expensive. Instead, an expert can label just a small set of breast cancer scans, and the semi-supervised algorithm would be able to leverage this small subset and apply it to a larger set of scans. For me, GAN’s are one of the most impressive examples of semi-supervised learning. Below is a video where a Generative Adversarial Network uses unsupervised learning to map aspects from one image to another. A neural network known as a GAN (generative adversarial network) is used to synthesize pictures, without using labelled training data. Reinforcement Learning The final type of machine learning is by far my favourite. It is less common and much more complex, but it has generated incredible results. It doesn’t use labels as such, and instead uses rewards to learn. If you’re familiar with psychology, you’ll have heard of reinforcement learning. If not, you’ll already know the concept from how we learn in everyday life. In this approach, occasional positive and negative feedback is used to reinforce behaviours. Think of it like training a dog, good behaviours are rewarded with a treat and become more common. Bad behaviours are punished and become less common. This reward-motivated behaviour is key in reinforcement learning. This is very similar to how we as humans also learn. Throughout our lives, we receive positive and negative signals and constantly learn from them. The chemicals in our brain are one of many ways we get these signals. When something good",3
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"Preprint submitted to the 6th ASMO UK / ISSMO conference. Oxford, 3rd – 4th July 2006  Particle Swarm Optimization: Development of a General-Purpose Optimizer  M. S. Innocente† and J. Sienz†  †University of Wales Swansea, Centre for Polymer Processing Simulation and Design, C2EC  Research Centre, Swansea, SA2 8PP, Wales-UK.  mauroinnocente@yahoo.com.ar              J.Sienz@swansea.ac.uk  Keywords: optimization, particle swarm, evolutionary algorithm, parameters’ tuning, stopping criteria, constraint- handling Abstract  For problems where the quality of any solution can be  quantified in a numerical value, optimization is the process of  finding the permitted combination of variables in the problem  that optimizes that value. Traditional methods present a very  restrictive range of applications, mainly limited by the features  of the function to be optimized and of the constraint functions.  In contrast, evolutionary algorithms present almost no  restriction to the features of these functions, although the most  appropriate constraint-handling technique is still an open  question. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is  sometimes viewed as another evolutionary algorithm because  of their many similarities, despite not being inspired by the  same metaphor. Namely, they evolve a population of  individuals taking into consideration previous experiences and  using stochastic operators to introduce new responses. The  advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to  traditional methods have been greatly discussed in the  literature for decades. While all such advantages are valid  when comparing the PSO paradigm to traditional methods, its  main advantages with respect to evolutionary algorithms  consist of its noticeably lower computational cost and easier  implementation. In fact, the plain version can be programmed  in a few lines of code, involving no operator design and few  parameters to be tuned. This paper deals with three important  aspects of the method: the influence of the parameters’ tuning  on the behaviour of the system; the design of stopping criteria  so that the reliability of the solution found can be somehow  estimated and computational cost can be saved; and the  development of appropriate techniques to handle constraints,  given that the original method is designed for unconstrained  optimization problems.  INTRODUCTION  Optimization is the process of seeking the combination  of variables that leads to the best performance of the  model, where “best” is measured according to a pre- defined criterion, usually subject to a set of constraints.  Thus, setting different combinations of values of the  “variables” allows trying different candidate solutions,  the “constraints” limit the valid combinations, and the  “optimality criterion” allows differentiating better from  worse. Traditional optimization methods exhibit several  weaknesses such as a number of requirements that either  the function to be optimized or the constraint functions  must comply with for the technique to be applicable,  and their usual incapability of escaping local optima.  Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) comprise a number of  techniques developed along the last few decades, which  are inspired by evolution processes that natural  organisms undergo to adapt to a dynamic environment  in order to survive. Since these organisms adapt by  seeking the best response to the challenge they are  facing, they happen to perform complex optimization  processes, which can be viewed as processes of fitness  maximization. It is important to remark that, since they  do not specifically intend to perform optimization but to  adapt to the environment, it is frequently claimed that  they are not “optimization” but “adaptation” methods. It  turns out that such adaptation results in optimizing the  fitness of the individuals. Although these methods  typically require higher computational resources than  traditional methods, they do not impose restrictions on  the features of the function to be optimized or on the  formulation of the constraints. Last but not least, they  are not problem-specific but general-purpose methods,  which require few adaptations or none to deal with  different problems, as opposed to traditional methods.  On the one hand, EAs can be viewed as “modern  heuristic techniques” because they are not developed in  a deterministic fashion. That is to say that they are not  designed to optimize a given problem but to perform  some procedures which are not directly related to the  optimization process. Optimization occurs, nevertheless,  despite there not being clear, evident links between the  implemented technique and the resulting optimization  process1. On the other hand, EAs can also be viewed as  “Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques”2, because their    1 Detractors of modern heuristics argue that using them implies  giving up on understanding the real problem.  2 More precisely, “Artificial Life (AL) techniques”.

Oxford, 3rd – 4th July 2006  ability to optimize is an emergent property that is not  specifically intended, and therefore not implemented in  the code. EAs are not designed to optimize but to carry  out some kind of artificial evolution performing  biological-like evolution processes such as mutation,  recombination, and selection, which results in the  maximization of a fitness function that resembles  biological evolution. Thus, the boundaries between the  fields of optimization and AI become vague, and the  optimization field becomes multidisciplinary, involving  mathematics, computer science, engineering, genetics,  and social psychology, to name a few.  Swarm intelligence (SI) is the branch of AI which is  concerned with the study of the collective behaviour  that emerges from decentralized and self-organized  systems. It is the property of a system whose individual  parts interact locally with one another and",2
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"A particle swarm searching for the global minimum of a function Particle swarm optimization In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO)[1] is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search- space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions. PSO is originally attributed to Kennedy, Eberhart and Shi[2][3] and was first intended for simulating social behaviour,[4] as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The book by Kennedy and Eberhart[5] describes many philosophical aspects of PSO and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of PSO applications is made by Poli.[6][7] In 2017, a comprehensive review on theoretical and experimental works on PSO has been published by Bonyadi and Michalewicz.[1] PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. Also, PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi- newton methods. However, metaheuristics such as PSO do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found. A basic variant of the PSO algorithm works by having a population (called a swarm) of candidate solutions (called particles). These particles are moved around in the search-space according to a few simple formulae.[8] The movements of the particles are guided by their own best-known position in the search-space as well as the entire swarm's best-known position. When improved positions are being discovered these will then come to guide the movements of the swarm. The process is repeated and by doing so it is hoped, but not guaranteed, that a satisfactory solution will eventually be discovered. Formally, let f:  ℝn  → ℝ be the cost function which must be minimized. The function takes a candidate solution as an argument in the form of a vector of real numbers and produces a real number as output which indicates the objective function value of the given candidate solution. The Algorithm Performance landscape showing how a simple PSO variant performs in aggregate on several benchmark problems when varying two PSO parameters. gradient of f is not known. The goal is to find a solution a for which f(a) ≤ f(b) for all b in the search-space, which would mean a is the global minimum. Let S be the number of particles in the swarm, each having a position xi ∈ ℝn in the search-space and a velocity vi ∈ ℝn. Let pi be the best known position of particle i and let g be the best known position of the entire swarm. A basic PSO algorithm to minimize the cost function is then:[9] for each particle i = 1, ..., S do     Initialize the particle's position with a uniformly distributed random vector: xi ~ U(blo, bup)     Initialize the particle's best known position to its initial position: pi ← xi     if f(pi) < f(g) then         update the swarm's best known position: g ← pi     Initialize the particle's velocity: vi ~ U(-|bup-blo|, |bup-blo|) while a termination criterion is not met do:     for each particle i = 1, ..., S do         for each dimension d = 1, ..., n do             Pick random numbers: rp, rg ~ U(0,1)             Update the particle's velocity: vi,d ← w vi,d + φp rp (pi,d-xi,d) + φg rg (gd-xi,d)         Update the particle's position: xi ← xi + vi         if f(xi) < f(pi) then             Update the particle's best known position: pi ← xi             if f(pi) < f(g) then                 Update the swarm's best known position: g ← pi The values blo and bup represent the lower and upper boundaries of the search-space respectively. The w parameter is the inertia weight. The parameters φp and φg are often called cognitive coefficient and social coefficient. The termination criterion can be the number of iterations performed, or a solution where the adequate objective function value is found.[10] The parameters w, φp, and φg are selected by the practitioner and control the behaviour and efficacy of the PSO method (below). The choice of PSO parameters can have a large impact on optimization performance. Selecting PSO parameters that yield good performance has therefore been the subject of much research.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] To prevent divergence (""explosion"") the inertia weight must be smaller than 1. The two other parameters can be then derived thanks to the constriction approach,[16] or freely selected, but the analyses suggest convergence domains to constrain them. Typical values are in  . The PSO parameters can also be tuned by using another overlaying  optimizer,  a  concept  known  as  meta- optimization,[20][21][22][23] or even fine-tuned during the optimization, e.g., by means of fuzzy logic.[24][25] Parameters have also been tuned for various optimization scenarios.[26][27] Parameter selection The topology of the swarm defines the subset of particles with which each particle can exchange information.[28] The basic version of the algorithm uses the global topology as the swarm communication structure.[10] This topology allows all particles to communicate with all the other particles, thus the whole swarm share the same best position g from a single particle. However, this approach might lead the swarm to be trapped into a local",3
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"Preprint submitted to Trends in Engineering Computational Technology  doi:10.4203/csets.20.6  1  Abstract    The advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to traditional methods have  been greatly discussed in the literature. While particle swarm optimizers share such  advantages, they outperform evolutionary algorithms in that they require lower  computational cost and easier implementation, involving no operator design and few  coefficients to be tuned. However, even marginal variations in the settings of these  coefficients greatly influence the dynamics of the swarm. Since this paper does not  intend to study their tuning, general-purpose settings are taken from previous stud- ies, and virtually the same algorithm is used to optimize a variety of notably differ- ent problems. Thus, following a review of the paradigm, the algorithm is tested on a  set of benchmark functions and engineering problems taken from the literature. Lat- er, complementary lines of code are incorporated to adapt the method to combinato- rial optimization as it occurs in scheduling problems, and a real case is solved using  the same optimizer with the same settings. The aim is to show the flexibility and ro- bustness of the approach, which can handle a wide variety of problems.

The lack of limitations to the features of the varia- bles and functions that model the problem enable these methods to handle models  whose high complexity does not allow traditional, deterministic, analytical ap- proaches. While the advantages of PSO and EAs with respect to traditional methods  are roughly the same, the main advantages of PSO when compared to EAs are its  lower computational cost and easier implementation. Regarding their drawbacks,  both these methods require higher computational effort, some constraint-handling  technique incorporated, and find it hard to handle equality constraints.    Population-based methods like EAs and PSO are considered modern heuristics  because they are not designed to optimize a given problem deterministically but to  carry out some procedures that are not directly related to the optimization problem.  Optimization occurs without evident links between the implemented technique and  the resulting optimization process. They are also viewed as Artificial Intelligence  (AI) techniques because their ability to optimize is an emergent property that is not  specifically intended, and therefore not implemented in the code. Thus, the problem  per se is not analytically solved, but artificial-intelligent entities are implemented,  which are expected to find a solution themselves. In particular, Swarm Intelligence  (SI) is the branch of AI concerned with the study of the collective behaviour that  emerges from decentralized and self-organized systems. It is the property of a sys- tem whose individual parts interact locally with one another and with their environ- ment, inducing the emergence of coherent global patterns that the individual parts  are unaware of. PSO is viewed as one of the most prominent SI-based methods. Ei- ther modern heuristics or AI-based optimizers, these methods are not deterministi- cally designed to optimize. EAs perform some kind of artificial evolution, where  individuals in a population undergo simulated evolutionary processes which results  in the maximization of a fitness function, resembling biological evolution. Likewise,  PSO consists of a sort of simulation of a social milieu, where the ability of the popu- lation to optimize its performance emerges from the cooperation among individuals.    Although the basic particle swarm optimizer requires the tuning of a few coeffi- cients only, even marginal variations in their values have a strong impact on the dy- namics of the swarm. The general-purpose settings used throughout this paper were  taken from previous studies (see Innocente [2]) because the objective is not to study  their tuning but to demonstrate that virtually the same algorithm is able to cope with  a variety of problems that would require different traditional methods to be solved.  Thus, this paper intends to introduce the PSO method, pose the optimization and  scheduling problems, and solve them with essentially the same algorithm. Addition- al code is required to turn the continuous search algorithm into a scheduler.    2  Mathematical optimization    For problems where the quality of a solution can be quantified in a numerical value,  optimization is the process of seeking the permitted combination",2
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"In optimization, simulated annealing starts with random solutions and makes changes, accepting worse solutions early on (just like how high temperatures allow for more flexibility in metals) and gradually reducing the acceptance rate as the temperature cools. Both SA and EAs use randomness to explore the solution space, but the key difference is that EAs work with populations of solutions, while SA focuses on improving a single solution over time. SA is more straightforward but might miss out on the broader exploration that EAs achieve by working with multiple solutions at once. Particle Swarm Optimization vs Evolutionary Algorithms Now, let’s talk about Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) — another population- based technique. PSO is inspired by how birds flock together or how fish swim in schools. It’s like the members of the population, or “particles,” fly through the solution space, guided by both their own experience and the knowledge of the entire swarm. You can think of it as a cooperative strategy where each particle adjusts its position based on its own “best-known position” and the “best-known position” of its neighbors. How does this compare to EAs? While both use a population to search the solution space, PSO focuses more on swarm intelligence, where particles share information to improve the whole group. EAs, on the other hand, rely on evolutionary principles — selection, crossover, and mutation — to evolve the population over generations. PSO can be faster because it doesn’t perform crossover or mutation, but EAs can be more effective in highly complex and rugged landscapes due to their genetic diversity. Applications of Evolutionary Algorithms You might be thinking: “Okay, I get the theory — but where do evolutionary algorithms actually shine in the real world?” Well, EAs are incredibly versatile, and their applications range from engineering to creative arts. Let’s break it down. Optimization in Engineering In engineering, optimization problems are everywhere — from designing aerodynamics to optimizing structures for strength and weight. Evolutionary algorithms are particularly useful when the solution space is vast and filled with constraints. For instance, when optimizing the shape of an airplane wing, traditional methods might struggle to balance conflicting requirements (like lift vs. drag). EAs can explore different designs, evolving solutions over time to find a balance that meets all objectives. You’ll also see EAs used in control system design, manufacturing processes, and mechanical optimization, where the number of variables and constraints make it difficult to use conventional techniques. Machine Learning If you’ve ever struggled with hyperparameter tuning in machine learning, evolutionary algorithms might just be your savior. You can use EAs to evolve neural network architectures — a process known as neuroevolution. Instead of manually designing the network structure, the EA searches for the best architecture by tweaking the number of layers, neurons, and connections. This is especially helpful when you’re working with deep learning models that have tons of hyperparameters to optimize. EAs can also be applied to evolve decision trees, tune parameters in support vector machines, or optimize any machine learning algorithm where the search space is large and complex. Artificial Creativity This might surprise you: EAs aren’t just for technical fields — they can be used to generate art and music. In evolutionary art, an algorithm evolves visual images by mutating and combining different designs until an aesthetically pleasing result is achieved. Similarly, in music, evolutionary algorithms can be used to compose melodies by evolving musical structures based on user feedback or predefined fitness criteria. You’re essentially “breeding” creativity, evolving novel patterns that might never have been imagined otherwise. Some artists and researchers are using EAs to push the boundaries of creative exploration. Robotics When it comes to robotics, EAs have a major role in both design and control. Imagine you’re designing a robot that needs to navigate through rough terrain. You can use evolutionary algorithms to optimize both the robot’s physical design and its control systems. EAs are particularly effective in path planning, where a robot must figure out the best route to a destination while avoiding obstacles. Another application is in evolutionary robotics, where the entire behavior of a robot can be evolved, from how it walks to how it interacts with its environment. Operations Research In the world of logistics, transportation, and resource allocation, finding the most efficient solution is often critical. Evolutionary algorithms can help solve problems like the traveling salesman problem (finding the shortest route through a set of cities) or vehicle routing problems, where you need to optimize the delivery of goods to multiple locations. These problems involve large, complex solution spaces that traditional methods struggle with. EAs explore a variety of potential routes, evolving towards the most efficient one based on criteria like distance, time, and cost. Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithms This might surprise you, but evolutionary algorithms aren’t always working solo. Sometimes, they need a little help from other optimization techniques to really hit that sweet spot. This is where hybrid evolutionary algorithms come into play. Hybridization with Other Techniques Let’s say your evolutionary algorithm is doing a good job exploring the solution space but isn’t quite refining its search as efficiently as you’d like. This is where you can combine it with other methods like hill-climbing or simulated annealing to boost performance. Hill-climbing is like adding a finishing touch — it helps fine-tune a solution once you’re already in a good neighborhood, while simulated annealing adds another layer of randomness to help escape local optima. For example, you might run a",2
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"offspring are selected⁴. This process is repeated for a given number of iterations and the position of the individual with the best result is recorded. Particle swarm optimization is a technique inspired from the movement of birds in the sky during migration. Birds migrate as a flock towards a more suitable climate region. When one of the birds in the periphery senses a warmer region, it changes its direction of flight and immediately all other birds follow. Again if another bird senses a warmer region, it directs the movement of the flock again. The movement of individuals in PSO is inspired from this phenomenon. In PSO there are control variables called global_best(gb), which stores the position of the individual with the best score so for, and personal_best(pb), which stores the best position that each individual has visited so far. Each individual moves a little towards its pb and a little towards its gb. The distance that they move in each direction is reduced with each iteration. Nature-inspired algorithms are very useful if the search landscape is not continuous, or if the objective functions are too complex. This makes them very useful for hyperparameter optimization in deep learning. Let us take a simple neural network as an example. Its hyper-parameters are learning rate(α), batch size, optimizer, learning rate decay, no of hidden layers, no of neurons in each hidden layer. All these make up the input vector x in Definition 1. The objective functions fᵢ are the accuracy on the validation set, loss function, precision etc. This problem has many constraints gᵢ. For example, 0<α<1. If we use nature-inspired meta-heuristics to solve the above problem, then each individual with be initialized with some values of the hyper-parameters, and training will happen with all of them. In case of Genetic Algorithm,for example, all the individuals who give large loss will be eliminated and new individuals are created for the next iteration. This process will repeat for the given number of iterations. Accuracy as a function of hyperparameters in a neural network is extremely complex. The hyperparameters determine the number of actual parameters and their values in the neural network. They determine the entire training process. So you can imagine how difficult it would be to represent the accuracy as a function of hyperparameters. So deterministic optimization or simple heuristics cannot solve this problem. Nature-inspired population-based metaheuristics like Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization can solve them reasonably well. References 1. Yang, X. S. (2010).

How is AI used in everyday life?,"AI can be categorized into two main types: 1. Narrow AI (or Weak AI): This type of AI is programmed to perform a narrow task like facial recognition, internet searches, or driving a car. Most of the AI encountered in day-to-day life, from chatbots to virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, falls under this category. Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a frontier in computer science, aiming to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. In essence, AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It’s related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to biologically observable methods. Defining AI The definition of AI is often a topic of debate, but at its core, it involves machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include planning, understanding language, recognizing objects and sounds, learning, and problem solving. We can consider AI to be a system that perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Brief History of AI AI as a concept has been around for centuries, with roots in Greek mythology. Modern AI, however, began in the 20th century with the development of the Turing Test by Alan Turing, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called “intelligent.” The field of AI research was formally founded at a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956. Types of AI Recently in technology, two terms frequently come up: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Often used interchangeably, these terms actually describe different, though closely related, concepts in the realm of computer science. The goal of this article is to explain these concepts in a simple, straightforward manner, making them accessible to those with little or no existing knowledge in the field. I aim to provide a clear understanding of both AI and ML, how they work, and what differentiates them. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? 2. General AI (or Strong AI): This is a type of AI that has a broader range and is more akin to human cognition. It can intelligently solve a variety of problems, learn new tasks, and perform a variety of tasks. General AI is still a largely theoretical concept, with no existing examples as of now. As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, ethical considerations are increasingly important. Issues like privacy, security, and the potential impact on employment are significant topics of discussion. Ensuring that AI benefits society while minimizing its risks is a challenge that needs ongoing attention. The Future of AI The future of AI promises advancements in various fields and the potential to solve complex global challenges. However, it also poses significant challenges and risks that need to be managed responsibly. Various technologies are used in AI, including: 1. Machine Learning: Allowing machines to learn from data. 2. Natural Language Processing: Enabling machines to understand and interact with human language. 3. Robotics: The field of creating robots that can perform tasks in the physical world. 4. Neural Networks: Computer systems modeled on the human brain and nervous system. AI is now a part of everyday life and is used in a range of sectors. For example, in healthcare, AI is used to predict patient risk and improve diagnostics. In finance, it’s used for algorithmic trading and risk management. In the consumer sector, AI powers personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, as well as recommendation systems used by companies like Netflix and Amazon.

How is AI used in everyday life?,"this position from what he called ""weak AI"": A physical symbol system can act intelligently.[9] Searle introduced the terms to isolate strong AI from weak AI so he could focus on what he thought was the more interesting and debatable issue. He argued that even if we assume that we had a computer program that acted exactly like a human mind, there would still be a difficult philosophical question that needed to be answered.[9] Can a machine have a mind, consciousness, and mental states? 8/6/24, 6:11 PM Philosophy of artificial intelligence - Wikipedia  6/20 Neither of Searle's two positions are of great concern to AI research, since they do not directly answer the question ""can a machine display general intelligence?"" (unless it can also be shown that consciousness is necessary for intelligence). Turing wrote ""I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness… [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think].""[53] Russell and Norvig agree: ""Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.""[54] There are a few researchers who believe that consciousness is an essential element in intelligence, such as Igor Aleksander, Stan Franklin, Ron Sun, and Pentti Haikonen, although their definition of ""consciousness"" strays very close to ""intelligence"". (See artificial consciousness.) Before we can answer this question, we must be clear what we mean by ""minds"", ""mental states"" and ""consciousness"". The words ""mind"" and ""consciousness"" are used by different communities in different ways. Some new age thinkers, for example, use the word ""consciousness"" to describe something similar to Bergson's ""élan vital"": an invisible, energetic fluid that permeates life and especially the mind. Science fiction writers use the word to describe some essential property that makes us human: a machine or alien that is ""conscious"" will be presented as a fully human character, with intelligence, desires, will, insight, pride and so on. (Science fiction writers also use the words ""sentience"", ""sapience"", ""self-awareness"" or ""ghost""—as in the Ghost in the Shell manga and anime series—to describe this essential human property). For others , the words ""mind"" or ""consciousness"" are used as a kind of secular synonym for the soul. For philosophers, neuroscientists and cognitive scientists, the words are used in a way that is both more precise and more mundane: they refer to the familiar, everyday experience of having a ""thought in your head"", like a perception, a dream, an intention or a plan, and to the way we see something, know something, mean something or understand something.[55] ""It's not hard to give a commonsense definition of consciousness"" observes philosopher John Searle.[56] What is mysterious and fascinating is not so much what it is but how it is: how does a lump of fatty tissue and electricity give rise to this (familiar) experience of perceiving, meaning or thinking? Philosophers call this the hard problem of consciousness. It is the latest version of a classic problem in the philosophy of mind called the ""mind-body problem"".[57] A related problem is the problem of meaning or understanding (which philosophers call ""intentionality""): what is the connection between our thoughts and what we are thinking about (i.e. objects and situations out in the world)? A third issue is the problem of experience (or ""phenomenology""): If two people see the same thing, do they have the same experience? Or are there things ""inside their head"" (called ""qualia"") that can be different from person to person?[58] Neurobiologists believe all these problems will be solved as we begin to identify the neural correlates of consciousness: the actual relationship between the machinery in our heads and its collective properties; such as the mind, experience and understanding. Some of the harshest critics of artificial intelligence agree that the brain is just a machine, and that consciousness and intelligence are the result of physical processes in the brain.[59] The difficult philosophical question Consciousness, minds, mental states, meaning 8/6/24, 6:11 PM Philosophy of artificial intelligence - Wikipedia  7/20 is this: can a computer program, running on a digital machine that shuffles the binary digits of zero and one, duplicate the ability of the neurons to create minds, with mental states (like understanding or perceiving), and ultimately, the experience of consciousness? John Searle asks us to consider a thought experiment: suppose we have written a computer program that passes the Turing test and demonstrates general intelligent action. Suppose, specifically that the program can converse in fluent Chinese. Write the program on 3x5 cards and give them to an ordinary person who does not speak Chinese. Lock the person into a room and have him follow the instructions on the cards. He will copy out Chinese characters and pass them in and out of the room through a slot. From the outside, it will appear that the Chinese room contains a fully intelligent person who speaks Chinese. The question is this: is there anyone (or anything) in the room that understands Chinese? That is, is there anything that has the mental state of understanding, or which has conscious awareness of what is being discussed in Chinese? The man is clearly not aware. The room cannot be aware. The cards certainly are not aware. Searle concludes that the Chinese room, or any other physical symbol system, cannot have a mind.[60] Searle goes on to argue that actual mental states and consciousness require (yet to be described) ""actual physical-chemical properties of actual human brains.""[61] He argues there are special ""causal properties"" of brains and neurons that gives rise to minds: in his words ""brains cause minds.""[62] Gottfried Leibniz made essentially the same argument as Searle in 1714, using",3

Now, lets look into what each term means. What is AI, ML, and DL? AI: Developing machines to mimic human intelligence and behavior Artificial intelligence is the broad idea that machines can intelligently execute tasks by mimicking human behaviors and thought process using algorithms, data, and models. AI predicts, automates, and complete tasks typically done by humans with greater accuracy and precision, reduces bias, cost and timesaving. What is learning? We learn things in certain ways. How do human generally learn? Remember, generalize and keep adapting to changing things. We will incorporate these things into machines. ML: Algorithms that learn from structured data to predict output and discover patterns in that data. Machine learning, a subset of AI, revolves around the idea that machines can learn and adapt through experiences and data to complete specific tasks. This uses methods from statistics, operational research, and physics to find hidden insights within data without being programmed where to look or what to conclude. Machine learning is used to develop self-learning processing where software is given instructions on accomplishing a specific task. An example would be predicting the weather forecast for the next seven days based on data from previous year and previous week. Every day, the data from the previous year/week changes, so the ML model must adapt to the new data. 8/12/24, 11:00 AM Introduction to AI.

Deep learning is a subset of ML. It is a evolution of machine learning and neural networks which uses advanced computer programming and training to understand complex patterns hidden in large dataset. DL is about understanding how the human brain works in different situations and then trying to recreate its behaviour. For example, deep learning (combined with computer vision) in a driverless car can identify a person crossing the road. Also, used for complicated problems such as facial recognition, defect detection and image processing. We will discuss examples regarding which type of situations to use ML/DL and the benefits of using one over the other in the following sections. When to use AI?

Use ML when you are looking to teach a model how to perform a task, such as predicting an output or discovering a pattern using structured data. For example, Spotify build a customized playlist based on your favorite songs and the data from other users who share your likes and dislikes. When to use DL? DL is used to complete complex tasks and train models using unstructured data. For example, deep learning is commonly used in image classification tasks like facial recognition. Although machine learning models can also identify faces, deep learning models are more accurate. In this case, it takes the unstructured data (images of faces) and extracts factors such as the various facial features. The extracted features are then matched to those stored in a database.

How is AI used in everyday life?,"A Brief Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Arpan Thind · Follow 8 min read · Nov 11, 2021 Listen Share More Source:  What is Artificial Intelligence? Artificial intelligence (AI) is the science of making machines smart using algorithms to help computers solve problems, which used to be solved only by humans. Most AI examples that you hear about today — like chatboxes to self-driving cars — rely heavily on deep learning and machine learning. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data. A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence AI is not as modern as we think it is. AI dates all the way back to 1950 when Alan Turing created the Turing test. Later in the 1960s, ELIZA, the first chatbot program, was created. A chess computer was made by IBM in 1977, and it beat a world chess champion in two of its six games, while the champion won one, and the other three were all drawn. Apple introduced Siri as its digital assistant in 2011. Elon Musk and some others founded OpenAI in 2015. Different Types of Artificial Intelligence There are several of AI as outlined below: Analytic AI By using machine learning, including deep learning, one of the most advanced methods available, analytical AI can scan thousands of data points to uncover patterns and dependencies, ultimately assisting businesses in making informed decisions. Among the many applications of analytic AI are sentiment analysis and supplier risk assessment. Functional AI The purpose of functional AI is very similar to analytic AI — it scans vast amounts of data and tries to identify patterns and dependencies among them. Unlike analytic AI, functional AI takes actions rather than making recommendations. Using sensor data from a specific machine, an IoT cloud can, for instance, spot a pattern of potential machine breakdowns and act on it. A second example is the robots that Amazon employs to move the goods from the shelves to the pickers, thus speeding up the picking process. Interactive AI Businesses can automate communication with this type of AI without compromising on interaction. This type of AI can be visualized by imagining chatbots and smart personal assistants that can answer pre-programmed questions and understand the context of conversations. A company’s internal processes can be improved by using interactive AI. Text AI The use of Text AI can offer businesses the ability to recognize texts, convert speech to text, and translate content. This type of AI can be utilized even by companies that are not Google, Amazon, or any other giant companies that offer text AI services. An internal corporate knowledge base can be powered by text AI, for instance. When compared with a traditional knowledge base, which relies on keyword searching, an AI-enabled one can locate documents containing the most relevant information even if they do not contain keywords. AI can build semantic maps from natural language processing and recognize synonyms to understand the context of the user’s question thanks to semantic search and natural language processing. Visual AI Businesses can transform images and videos into insights by using visual AI to identify, recognize, classify, and sort objects. As an example, a machine that grades apples according to their colour and size or one that helps insurers estimate damage with damaged car photos constitutes visual AI. Computer vision and augmented reality are areas in which this type of AI can be applied. Self-awareness AI systems that are self-aware are among the lesser-known types of AI that currently exist only in theory. The ultimate goal of AI is to reach this phase. This technology would be explored and developed with the intention of achieving this phase of consciousness. Artificial intelligence systems that are self-aware would be so advanced and so in tune with the human brain that they would have a sufficient degree of self- consciousness and self-awareness. There is no clear estimate as to how long it will take to develop these types of AI systems. AI systems that are self-aware may take decades, if not even centuries, to develop. Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning AI is a vast and growing field that also includes a lot more subfields like machine learning and deep learning. AI, deep learning, and machine learning are often confused as they easily overlap. In its broadest sense, machine learning implies giving computers the capability to learn on their own. By using data provided by humans, machines are able to make accurate predictions using machine learning. It is simply a technique for realizing AI, since machine learning is just a subset of artificial intelligence. It is a technique for teaching algorithms how to make decisions. When one trains their algorithm in machine learning, they have to give a lot of data to it so that it can learn more about the information it has processed. The goal of deep learning is simply to make machine learning practical. By definition, deep learning is a subset of machine learning. To put it another way, it is the next evolution of machine learning. The information processing patterns in the human brain are roughly modelled by deep learning algorithms. Deep learning algorithms can be taught to accomplish the same tasks for machines as humans do by identifying patterns and classifying various types of information. Artificial Intelligence at Work Today There are numerous, real-world applications of AI systems today. Below are some of the most common examples: Banking Several banks have begun adopting AI-based programs to provide customer support and detect credit card fraud.

How is AI used in everyday life?,"What is Artificial Intelligence and How Does it Work? For Beginners! Demystifying Artificial Intelligence: Understanding AI Basics for Non-Programmers Charles Render · Follow 9 min read · Jul 27, 2023 Listen Share More Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology that is reshaping industries and revolutionizing the way we live and work. For business owners, managers, and curious beginners, understanding the fundamentals of AI is essential for making informed decisions and harnessing its potential to drive growth and innovation. In this article, we will delve deep into the world of AI, exploring its core principles, practical applications, and future implications. Understanding Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that traditionally require human intelligence. The field includes various subfields, each with its own focus and application. Machine learning is one such subfield, where algorithms enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. Natural language processing focuses on enabling machines to understand and interact with human language, while computer vision enables machines to interpret and understand visual information. Robotics combines AI with physical systems to create intelligent machines capable of interacting with the physical world. Machine Learning: The Essence of AI Machine learning, a subset of AI, lies at the heart of many AI applications. It allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming. Machine learning algorithms identify patterns and relationships within data, extract meaningful insights, and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. This ability to learn from experience enables machines to automate tasks, recognize speech, classify images, and more. Machine learning is a fundamental subset of AI that plays a crucial role in enabling computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. It provides machines with the ability to automatically learn patterns, make predictions, and make decisions without explicit programming. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled examples to make predictions or classifications. It is provided with a dataset where each data point is associated with a target value or label. The algorithm analyzes the features of the data and learns to map them to the corresponding target value. This allows the algorithm to make accurate predictions or classifications for new, unseen data. For example, in a spam email classification system, the algorithm is trained on a dataset of labeled emails, where each email is classified as either spam or non-spam. By analyzing the features of the emails, such as the words used or the presence of certain keywords, the algorithm learns to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. Once trained, it can accurately classify new emails as spam or non-spam. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves learning from unlabeled data, where the algorithm is not provided with any target labels. The algorithm analyzes the patterns and structures in the data to discover inherent relationships and groupings. Clustering algorithms are commonly used in unsupervised learning to group similar data points together. For example, in customer segmentation, an unsupervised learning algorithm can analyze customer data based on various attributes and group customers into segments based on their similarities. Reinforcement learning is a different paradigm of machine learning where an agent learns to interact with an environment and takes actions to maximize a reward signal. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions. It explores the environment, learns which actions yield higher rewards, and adjusts its behavior accordingly. Reinforcement learning has been successfully applied in various domains, including robotics, game playing, and autonomous vehicle control. Within each of these learning paradigms, there are numerous algorithms and techniques, such as decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, and deep learning. These algorithms differ in their approach to learning and the types of problems they are best suited for. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific problem at hand, the available data, and the desired outcome. To apply Machine learning effectively, several key steps are involved. These include data preprocessing, feature selection or extraction, model training, model evaluation, and deployment. Data preprocessing involves cleaning and transforming the data to ensure its quality and compatibility with the chosen algorithm. Feature selection or extraction focuses on identifying the most relevant features that will contribute to the learning process. Model training refers to the process of fitting the algorithm to the data, adjusting its parameters to minimize errors or maximize performance. Model evaluation assesses the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics and techniques. Finally, the trained model can be deployed to make predictions or automate decision-making tasks. Data Analytics and Data Science: The Pillars of AI Data analytics and data science play crucial roles in AI by providing the necessary tools and techniques to extract value from data.

What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Heuristic (computer science) In mathematical optimization and computer science, heuristic (from Greek εὑρίσκω ""I find, discover""[1]) is a technique designed for problem solving more quickly when classic methods are too slow for finding an exact or approximate solution, or when classic methods fail to find any exact solution in a search space. This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for speed. In a way, it can be considered a shortcut. A heuristic function, also simply called a heuristic, is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow. For example, it may approximate the exact solution.[2] The objective of a heuristic is to produce a solution in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem at hand. This solution may not be the best of all the solutions to this problem, or it may simply approximate the exact solution. But it is still valuable because finding it does not require a prohibitively long time. Heuristics may produce results by themselves, or they may be used in conjunction with optimization algorithms to improve their efficiency (e.g., they may be used to generate good seed values). Results about NP-hardness in theoretical computer science make heuristics the only viable option for a variety of complex optimization problems that need to be routinely solved in real-world applications. Heuristics underlie the whole field of Artificial Intelligence and the computer simulation of thinking, as they may be used in situations where there are no known algorithms.[3] The trade-off criteria for deciding whether to use a heuristic for solving a given problem include the following: Optimality: When several solutions exist for a given problem, does the heuristic guarantee that the best solution will be found? Is it actually necessary to find the best solution? Completeness: When several solutions exist for a given problem, can the heuristic find them all? Do we actually need all solutions? Many heuristics are only meant to find one solution. Accuracy and precision: Can the heuristic provide a confidence interval for the purported solution? Is the error bar on the solution unreasonably large? Execution time: Is this the best-known heuristic for solving this type of problem? Some heuristics converge faster than others. Some heuristics are only marginally quicker than classic Definition and motivation Trade-off methods, in which case the 'overhead' on calculating the heuristic might have a negative impact. In some cases, it may be difficult to decide whether the solution found by the heuristic is good enough because the theory underlying heuristics is not very elaborate. One way of achieving the computational performance gain expected of a heuristic consists of solving a simpler problem whose solution is also a solution to the initial problem. An example of approximation is described by Jon Bentley for solving the travelling salesman problem (TSP): ""Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"" so as to select the order to draw using a pen plotter. TSP is known to be NP-hard so an optimal solution for even a moderate size problem is difficult to solve. Instead, the greedy algorithm can be used to give a good but not optimal solution (it is an approximation to the optimal answer) in a reasonably short amount of time. The greedy algorithm heuristic says to pick whatever is currently the best next step regardless of whether that prevents (or even makes impossible) good steps later. It is a heuristic in the sense that practice indicates it is a good enough solution, while theory indicates that there are better solutions (and even indicates how much better, in some cases).[4] Another example of heuristic making an algorithm faster occurs in certain search problems. Initially, the heuristic tries every possibility at each step, like the full-space search algorithm. But it can stop the search at any time if the current possibility is already worse than the best solution already found. In such search problems, a heuristic can be used to try good choices first so that bad paths can be eliminated early (see alpha–beta pruning). In the case of best-first search algorithms, such as A* search, the heuristic improves the algorithm's convergence while maintaining its correctness as long as the heuristic is admissible. In their Turing Award acceptance speech, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon discuss the heuristic search hypothesis: a physical symbol system will repeatedly generate and modify known symbol structures until the created structure matches the solution structure. Each following step depends upon the step before it, thus the heuristic search learns what avenues to pursue and which ones to disregard by measuring how close the current step is to the solution. Therefore, some possibilities will never be generated as they are measured to be less likely to complete the solution. Examples Simpler problem Travelling salesman problem Search Newell and Simon: heuristic search hypothesis A heuristic method can accomplish its task by using search trees. However, instead of generating all possible solution branches, a heuristic selects branches more likely to produce outcomes than other branches. It is selective at each decision point, picking branches that are more likely to produce solutions.[5] Antivirus software often uses heuristic rules for detecting viruses and other forms of malware. Heuristic scanning looks for code and/or behavioral patterns common to a class or family of viruses, with different sets of rules for different viruses. If a file or executing process is found to contain matching code patterns and/or to be performing that set of activities, then the scanner infers that the file is infected. The most advanced",3
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Heuristic algorithms are techniques often used in the field of computer science and programming to achieve reasonably good solutions in a reasonable amount of time, especially when dealing with complex problems. In this article, we will discuss how heuristic algorithms utilize programming logic for efficient decision- making. Introduction to Heuristic Algorithms The term heuristic comes from the Greek word heuriskein, which means “to discover.” In the context of programming, heuristic algorithms are designed to solve problems quickly when traditional optimal approaches are impractical in terms of computational time. The primary aim of heuristic algorithms is to produce a “good enough” solution in a “fast enough” time, rather than seeking a perfect solution that requires unrealistic time. Applying Logic in Heuristic Algorithms Heuristic algorithms often involve rule-based or logical approaches to make decisions. Some examples of heuristic algorithms include search algorithms like A* (A-star), which uses logic to prioritize the most likely path to reach the goal at the lowest cost, or Greedy algorithms, which always make the best decision based on the current information. Here are examples of logic application in heuristic algorithms: 1. Greedy Algorithms: The logic in these algorithms is to always select the option that seems best at that moment, hoping that the best local choices will lead to the optimal global solution. In some cases, this approach might not yield the optimal solution, but it usually generates a good enough solution quickly. 2. A (A-star) Algorithms:* This algorithm uses logic to prioritize paths that seem likely to reach the goal with the lowest cost. This logic allows the algorithm to focus on the most promising paths and ignore paths unlikely to yield efficient solutions. Conclusion In programming, the use of heuristic algorithms leverages logic to achieve efficient decisions in a reasonable time. Although the resulting solutions might not be the most optimal, they are typically good enough for most practical applications. Learning and understanding how heuristic algorithms work can help you become a more efficient and effective programmer.",3
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Heuristic Search in Artificial Intelligence — Python What is a Heuristic? A Heuristic is a technique to solve a problem faster than classic methods, or to find an approximate solution when classic methods cannot. This is a kind of a shortcut as we often trade one of optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for speed. A Heuristic (or a heuristic function) takes a look at search algorithms. At each branching step, it evaluates the available information and makes a decision on which branch to follow. It does so by ranking alternatives. The Heuristic is any device that is often effective but will not guarantee work in every case. Briefly, we can taxonomize such techniques of Heuristic into two categories: Other names for these are Blind Search, Uninformed Search, and Blind Control Strategy. These aren’t always possible since they demand much time or memory. They search the entire state space for a solution and use an arbitrary ordering of operations. Examples of these are Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS). So why do we need heuristics? One reason is to produce, in a reasonable amount of time, a solution that is good enough for the problem in question. It doesn’t have to be the best- an approximate solution will do since this is fast enough. Most problems are exponential. Heuristic Search let us reduce this to a rather polynomial number. We use this in AI because we can put it to use in situations where we can’t find known algorithms. We can say Heuristic Techniques are weak methods because they are vulnerable to combinatorial explosion. Heuristic Search Techniques in Artificial Intelligence a. Direct Heuristic Search Techniques in AI Heuristic Search Techniques in Artificial Intelligence Do you know about NLTK Python b. Weak Heuristic Search Techniques in AI Other names for these are Informed Search, Heuristic Search, and Heuristic Control Strategy. These are effective if applied correctly to the right types of tasks and usually demand domain-specific information. We need this extra information to compute preference among child nodes to explore and expand. Each node has a heuristic function associated with it. Examples are Best First Search (BFS) and A*. First, let’s talk about Hill Climbing. This is a heuristic for optimizing problems mathematically. We need to choose values from the input to maximize or minimize a real function. It is okay if the solution isn’t the global optimal maximum. Before we move on to describe certain techniques, let’s first take a look at the ones we generally observe. Below, we name a few. Best-First Search A* Search Bidirectional Search Tabu Search Beam Search Simulated Annealing Hill Climbing Constraint Satisfaction Problems Hill Climbing in Heuristic Search Heuristic Search Techniques — Hill Climbing Let’s discuss Python Speech Recognition One such example of Hill Climbing will be the widely discussed Travelling Salesman Problem- one where we must minimize the distance he travels. a. Features of Hill Climbing Let’s discuss some of the features of this algorithm (Hill Climbing): It is a variant of the generate-and-test algorithm It makes use of the greedy approach This means it keeps generating possible solutions until it finds the expected solution, and moves only in the direction which optimizes the cost function for it. b. Types of Hill Climbing Simple Hill Climbing- This examines one neighboring node at a time and selects the first one that optimizes the current cost to be the next node. Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing- This examines all neighboring nodes and selects the one closest to the solution state. Stochastic Hill Climbing- This selects a neighboring node at random and decides whether to move to it or examine another. Let’s revise Python Unit testing Let’s take a look at the algorithm for simple hill climbing. 1. Evaluate initial state- if goal state, stop and return success. Else, make initial state current. 2. Loop until the solution reached or until no new operators left to apply to current state: a. Select new operator to apply to the current producing new state. b. Evaluate new state: If a goal state, stop and return success. If better than the current state, make it current state, proceed. If not better than the current state, continue until the solution reached. A constraint is nothing but a limitation or a restriction. Working with AI, we may need to satisfy some constraints to solve problems. Let’s try solving a problem this way, shall we? Let’s talk of a magic square. This is a sequence of numbers- usually integers- arranged in a square grid. The numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal all add up to a constant which we call the Magic Constant. Let’s implement this with Python. 1. def magic_square(matrix): 2. size=len(matrix[0]) 3. sum_list=[] 4. for col in range(size): #Vertical sum 5. sum_list.append(sum(row[col] for row in matrix)) 6. sum_list.extend([sum(lines) for lines in matrix])#Horizontal sum Do you know about Python Assert Statements Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) 6/18 1. Exit. We usually run into one of three issues- Local Maximum- All neighboring states have values worse than the current. The greedy approach means we won’t be moving to a worse state. This terminates the process even though there may have been a better solution. As a workaround, we use backtracking. Plateau- All neighbors to it have the same value. This makes it impossible to choose a direction. To avoid this, we randomly make a big jump. Ridge- At a ridge, movement in all possible directions is downward. This makes it look like a peak and terminates the process. To avoid this, we may use two or more rules before testing. c. Problems with Hill Climbing 7. result1=0 8. for i in range(0,size): 9. result1+=matrix[i][i] 10. sum_list.append(result1) 11. result2=0 12. for i in range(size-1,-1,-1): 13. result2+=matrix[i][i] 14. sum_list.append(result2) 15. if len(set(sum_list))>1: 16. return False 17. return True Now let’s",3
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Searching entails locating a solution or the most efficient path within a given problem space in AI. It requires examining various states or configurations to achieve the desired goal state or identify the optimal solution. Informed search comprises search algorithms that leverage domain-specific information or heuristics to efficiently find the goal state in a search space. These algorithms make informed decisions on which path to explore, avoiding blind exploration of all possibilities. In AI, a heuristic is a problem-solving technique that uses practical rules or educated guesses to find solutions more quickly and efficiently. It provides a guiding principle or estimation to assess which actions or paths are more promising in reaching the goal state. Heuristics are often employed in informed search algorithms like Best First Search, A* search (discussed in a later section)to prioritize exploration of states that are likely to lead to the desired outcome, effectively reducing search complexity. However, the accuracy of heuristics heavily influences the algorithm’s performance and the quality of the solutions found. Best First Search Search: The primary objective of the best-first search is to expand the most promising nodes by relying on an evaluation function or heuristic. It exploits the benefits of both BFS (Breadth First Search) and DFS (Depth First Search)strategies. The best first search can switch between BFS (Breadth First Search) and DFS (Depth First Search) by gaining the advantages of both algorithms. We expand the node which is closest to the goal node and the closest cost is estimated by heuristic function h(n), f(n) = h(n) Here are the steps involved in the best-first search algorithm: 1. Initialization: Start with an initial state as the current state and create an empty priority queue to store the nodes. 2. Priority Queue: Add the initial state to the priority queue, considering the evaluation function or heuristic value for each state. 3. Loop: Repeat the following steps until either a goal state is found or the priority queue is empty. 4. Select Node: Dequeue the node with the highest priority (the lowest heuristic value) from the priority queue. This node represents the most promising state to explore next. 5. Goal Test: Check if the selected node is a goal state. If it is, the search is complete, and the solution is found. 6. Expand Node: Generate all possible successor states from the selected node. 7. Add to Queue: For each successor state, calculate its heuristic value using the evaluation function and add it to the priority queue. 8. Repeat: Continue the loop, selecting the next most promising node from the priority queue. Example: Graph Given Heuristic value In this search example, we utilize two lists: OPEN and CLOSED Lists. These lists help in managing and tracking the exploration of nodes during the search process. Expand the nodes of S and put them in the CLOSED list Initialization: Open [A, B], Closed [S] 3/9 Iteration 1: Open [A], Closed [S, B] Iteration 2: Open [E, F, A], Closed [S, B] : Open [E, A], Closed [S, B, F] Iteration 3: Open [I, G, E, A], Closed [S, B, F] : Open [I, E, A], Closed [S, B, F, G] Hence the final solution path will be: S — → B — — ->F — → G",2
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"strategies are generally applicable to other LLM-assisted search methods. • We comprehensively evaluate EoH on three widely- studied combinatorial optimization benchmark prob- lems. We demonstrate that EoH outperforms many existing AHD methods. In particular, EoH identifies 1Our work and its preliminary version (Liu et al., 2023b) were developed independently of Romera-Paredes et al. (2024). heuristics with better performance than those designed by FunSearch. EoH uses much fewer queries to LLMs than FunSearch on online bin packing problem. 2. Background and Related Works 2.1. Automatic Heuristic Design Automatic heuristic algorithm design is commonly known as hyper-heuristics (Burke et al., 2013; 2019; St¨utzle & L´opez- Ib´a˜nez, 2019). With various effective methodologies (Blot et al., 2016; L´opez-Ib´a˜nez et al., 2016; Akiba et al., 2019) and frameworks (Burke et al., 2019), one can tune heuristics or combine different algorithmic components in an auto- matic manner. Much effort has been made to use machine learning techniques in automatic algorithm design (Bengio et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; He et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023a). Among them, genetic programming (Mei et al., 2022; Jia et al., 2022) provides an explainable approach to algorithm design. However, it requires hand-crafted algo- rithmic components and domain knowledge. 2.2. LLMs for Heuristic Design Over the last few years, the ability of large language mod- els has increased significantly (Naveed et al., 2023). Re- cently, some effort has been made to use LLMs as basic algorithmic components to improve the performance of al- gorithms (Yang et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023a). Most of these works adopt LLM as optimizers (Yang et al., 2023) to directly generate new trial solutions through in-context learning. This approach faces challenges when applied to complex problems with large search space (Yang et al., 2023; Nasir et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023a). Oth- ers integrate LLMs to assist algorithm design to extract deep algorithm features for heuristic selection (Wu et al., 2023), provide a guide for heuristic (Shah et al., 2023), and design an algorithmic component (Xiao & Wang, 2023). How- ever, designing a competitive heuristic is still a challenge for standalone LLMs with prompt engineering. 2.3. LLMs + EC Evolutionary computation is a generic optimization princi- ple inspired by natural evolution (B¨ack et al., 1997; Eiben & Smith, 2015). Integration of EC in the prompt engi- neering of LLMs is very promising in improving perfor- mance in various domains (Guo et al., 2023b; Lehman et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024). Evolutionary methods have been adopted in both code generation (Liventsev et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2023; Lehman et al., 2024; Hemberg et al., 2024) and text generation (Guo et al., 2023b; Fernando et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023a). The most related work to our effort is FunSearch (Romera-Paredes et al., 2024), an evolutionary framework with LLMs to search functions automatically. Al- 2 Evolution of Heuristics: Towards Efficient Automatic Algorithm Design Using Large Language Model gorithms generated by FunSearch outperform hard-crafted algorithms on some optimization problems. However, Fun- Search is computationally expensive and usually needs to generate millions of programs (i.e., queries to LLMs) to identify an effective heuristic function, which is not very practical for many users. 3. Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) 3.1. Main Idea EoH aims at evolving both thoughts and codes to mimic the heuristic development conducted by human experts for efficient automatic heuristic design. To achieve this goal, EoH • maintains both a natural language description and its corresponding code implementation for each heuristic. In each trial, it allows LLMs to first generate a heuris- tic in terms of natural language and then generate its corresponding code. The natural language description summarizes the main idea and provides a high-level understanding, while the code provides implementa- tion details and settings that supplement the high-level thought. • employs several prompt strategies to guide LLMs to do reasoning over existing thoughts and codes. These strategies are designed to learn from previous experi- ences and effectively explore the heuristic space. They can be regarded as fine-grained in-context learning ap- proaches that combine thoughts and codes for heuristic search. • evolves a population of candidate heuristics. It uses LLMs in genetic operators such as crossover and muta- tion to produce new heuristics. Selection is also used to direct the search. The quality of each heuristic is evaluated on a set of problem instances. Unlike most evolutionary algorithms where individuals are candidate solutions to an optimization problem, An indi- vidual in EoH is a heuristic designed for solving a given problem. We believe that the evolution of “thoughts” should be an important research direction. EoH Integrates LLMs into an evolutionary framework. It generates and refines heuristics automatically. Unlike some classic automatic heuristic design methods (Burke et al., 2013), EoH doesn’t need any hand-crafted heuristic compo- nents or train new models. EoH evolves both thoughts and codes. Thoughts in natural language and designed prompt strategies enable EoH to generate more diverse and effective heuristics. In contrast, FunSearch performs evolution of codes only and does not use prompt strategies explicitly. 3.2. Evolution Framework EoH maintains a population of N heuristics, denoted as P = {h1, . . . , hN}, at each generation. Each heuristic hi is evaluated on a set of problem instances and assigned a fitness value f(hi). Five prompt strategies are designed to generate new heuris- tics. At each generation, each strategy is called N times to generate N heuristics. Each newly generated heuristic will be evaluated on problem instances and added to the current population if it is feasible. At most 5N new",0
What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"A Deep Architecture: Multi-Layer Perceptron Ninad Lunge · Follow 7 min read · Mar 24, 2024 Listen Share More Before beginning with the Perceptron, it is essential that we have some basic understanding about Artificial Neural Networks. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain’s interconnected network of neurons. It consists of interconnected nodes called artificial neurons, organized into layers. Information flows through the network, with each neuron processing input signals and producing an output signal that influences other neurons in the network. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network consisting of multiple layers of neurons. The neurons in the MLP typically use nonlinear activation functions, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in data. MLPs are significant in machine learning because they can learn nonlinear relationships in data, making them powerful models for tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition. Perceptron: Perceptron was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. A Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. This algorithm enables neurons to learn and processes elements in the training set one at a time. A Perceptron Multilayer Perceptron: A multilayer perceptron is a type of feedforward neural network consisting of fully connected neurons with a nonlinear kind of activation function. It is widely used to distinguish data that is not linearly separable. MLPs have been widely used in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition, among others. Their flexibility in architecture and ability to approximate any function under certain conditions make them a fundamental building block in deep learning and neural network research. Some of its key concepts are as follows: Input layer: The input layer consists of nodes or neurons that receive the initial input data. Each neuron represents a feature or dimension of the input data. The number of neurons in the input layer is determined by the dimensionality of the input data. Hidden layer: Between the input and output layers, there can be one or more layers of neurons. Each neuron in a hidden layer receives inputs from all neurons in the previous layer (either the input layer or another hidden layer) and produces an output that is passed to the next layer. The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer are hyperparameters that need to be determined during the model design phase. Output layer: This layer consists of neurons that produce the final output of the network. The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the nature of the task. In binary classification, there may be either one or two neurons depending on the activation function and representing the probability of belonging to one class; while in multi- class classification tasks, there can be multiple neurons in the output layer. Weights: Neurons in adjacent layers are fully connected to each other. Each connection has an associated weight, which determines the strength of the connection. These weights are learned during the training process. Bias Neurons: In addition to the input and hidden neurons, each layer (except the input layer) usually includes a bias neuron that provides a constant input to the neurons in the next layer. The bias neuron has its own weight associated with each connection, which is also learned during training. The bias neuron effectively shifts the activation function of the neurons in the subsequent layer, allowing the network to learn an offset or bias in the decision boundary. By adjusting the weights connected to the bias neuron, the MLP can learn to control the threshold for activation and better fit the training data. Activation Function: Typically, each neuron in the hidden layers and the output layer applies an activation function to its weighted sum of inputs. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and softmax. These functions introduce nonlinearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data. Training with Backpropagation: MLPs are trained using the backpropagation algorithm, which computes gradients of a loss function with respect to the model’s parameters and updates the parameters iteratively to minimize the loss. Layer by Layer Working of a Multilayer Perceptron: Example of a MLP having two hidden layers In a multilayer perceptron, neurons process information in a step-by-step manner, performing computations that involve weighted sums and nonlinear transformations. Let’s walk layer by layer to see the magic that goes within. Input layer: The input layer of an MLP receives input data, which could be features extracted from the input samples in a dataset. Each neuron in the input layer represents one feature. Neurons in the input layer do not perform any computations; they simply pass the input values to the neurons in the first hidden layer. Hidden layers: The hidden layers of an MLP consist of interconnected neurons that perform computations on the input data. Each neuron in a hidden layer receives input from all neurons in the previous layer. The inputs are multiplied by corresponding weights, denoted as w . The weights determine how much influence the input from one neuron has on the output of another. In addition to weights, each neuron in the hidden layer has an associated bias, denoted as b . The bias provides an additional input to the neuron, allowing it to adjust its output threshold. Like weights, biases are learned during training. For each neuron in a hidden layer or the output layer, the weighted sum of its inputs is computed. This involves multiplying each input by its corresponding weight, summing up these products, and adding the bias: Where n  is the total number of input connections, wi  is the weight",1

Image Generation: Creating realistic images, such as faces, objects, and scenes. 2. Image-to-Image Translation: Converting images from one domain to another (e.g., sketches to photos). 3. Data Augmentation: Generating additional training data to improve the performance of machine learning models. 4. Super-Resolution: Enhancing the resolution of images. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete against each other. The generator creates fake data, and the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. Through this adversarial process, GANs can generate realistic data.

What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"here is limited to the current types of ANN. For other types deﬁned in this article, there will be more fruitful results. ANN’s theory is just beginning. So ANN is a function approximation. If the human brain is also doing function ap- proximation, then ANN really imitates human well. 1 1 Activation Integral Representation of Functions 1.1 Activation Function The activation function is an important concept in artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), which is thought to be inspired by biological researchs such as cognitive neuroscience. In the mathematical sense, it is understood as mapping with composite function. Indeed, no matter what activation function is, it shows such a characteristic that it “ignores” the almost entire part of the change of function in its deﬁnition domain, while retaining a small part of the function in its deﬁnition domain. Therefore, starting from this idea, the neural network is using the “local reservation” property of so many activation functions to ﬁt a function. It is very similar to calculus, but it is not the case of limit. It suggests that the limit can be taken further and study a “continuous” neural network. But this is not what this section will discuss. This section only demonstrates that a given function can indeed be imitated locally by many activation functions. Later, these activation functions will show a good property, that is, they can be expressed by summation and composition, which is actually the principle of the ANN model. Here it is called the activation integral representation of function. Firstly, the deﬁnition of the activation function is deﬁned. Now the activation functions used in practical applications, such as the famous Sigmoid function, tanh function and so forth, will be considered. They are too special, however, because they are used so frequently, researchers have forgotten the original meaning of the activation function. These functions are only continuous functions that are conducive to gradient calculation[1] in the sense of continuity, which is the original meaning of choosing them. So, back to the original idea, start to analyze an activation function of the original pattern and give it a deﬁnition. Deﬁnition 1.1 The activation function f(x) is monotonic, continuous and deriv- able, satisfying lim x→∞f(x) →ymax and lim x→−∞f(x) →ymin. Here, the reason for not taking the two special values of 0 and 1 is that they have no special meaning in mathematics, they cater more to biological concepts and even just make people feel “comfortable”. In fact, in the next analysis, it will be found that this is not necessary and even for convenience, and it will be conceptualized to some extent. In short, the core idea of activation functions is to imitate only a small range of deﬁne domain of a function. In the following analysis, in order to simplify the discussion of the problem, a simple activation function is constructed. Its expression is f(x) = min{max{ymin, kx + b}, ymax}. It is known that the middle line segment is part of the straight line y = kx + b. Further, specifying ymin = 0 and ymax = 1, a simpliﬁed activation function is obtained, which is called linear activation function. It is known that the function is, f(x) = min{max{0, kx + b}, 1} 2 that satisﬁes the deﬁnition of activation function. For the x1 and x2 satisfying x1 = ymin −b k = 0 −b k = −b k and x2 = ymax −b k = 1 −b k . f ′(x1) = 0 and f ′(x2) = 0 are deﬁned. So the derivative of f(x) is f ′(x) = ( k −b k < x < 1−b k 0 Others . Such a deﬁnition is neither meaningless nor groundless. At the beginning, researchers did think about or use such a activation function, but they were powerless in gradient algorithm. Their derivatives are 0 in most deﬁne domain, which means that gradient al- gorithms are diﬃcult to work with such a function. So researchers use other functions instead. Another point to mention is that, in fact, the popular ReLu function can get this linear activation function mentioned above by composite operation. Linear functions have always had numerous advantages in analysis because they are simple. It also be used for subsequent analysis. Another intuitive understanding of the activation function is that as the independent variable of the activation function changes from small to big in the deﬁne domain, there will be a process of “rising” (or “falling”). This ascending (or descending) process is to imitate the above process of a function. 1.2 Activation Integral Literally speaking, the activation integral is actually the integral of activation function. The activation integral of a function is the expression of a function as the activation integral. The previous section has suggested that an activation function can imitate a function in a small interval, so it is easy to infer that a series of activation functions can imitate a function in larger or more intervals. Activation integral is a continuity concept based on this understanding. In order to derive the deﬁnition of activation integral, the following theorem is proved ﬁrst. Theorem 1.1 The arbitrary continuous and derivable function F(x), which can be decomposed into a series of activation functions f(x), has the following form: F(x) = Z f(t, x)dt = Z min{max{0, F ′(t)(x −t) + ε 2}, ε}dt. (1.1) Where F ′(x) is the derivative of F(x) for x, and ε is the inﬁnitesimal amount. Proof 1.1 For any point (x0, F(x0)) of the function F(x), the activation function at this point is deﬁned as f(x0, x) = min{max{ymin, F ′(x0)(x −x0) + F(x0)}, ymax}. Where F ′(x0) is the derivative value at point x0. f(x0, x) is tangent to F(x) at point x0. When |ymax −ymin| →0, |ymax −ymin| = ε, ∞ X i f(xi, x) = ∞ X i min{max{y(i) min, F ′(xi)(x −xi) + F(xi)}, y(i) max}. 3 Where {xi} is a series of ordered points randomly taken within the deﬁne domain of the function f(x). Further, ∞ X i f(xi, x) = ∞ X i min{max{0, F ′(xi)(x −xi) + F(xi) −y(i) min}, y(i) max −y(i) min} −y(i) min. ∵ymax+ymin 2 = F(x0), |ymax −ymin| = ymax −ymin = ε.",3
What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"unnormalized linear Transformer.[109][110][10] Transformers have increasingly become the model of choice for natural language processing.[111] Many modern large language models such as ChatGPT, GPT-4, and BERT use this architecture. ANNs began as an attempt to exploit the architecture of the human brain to perform tasks that conventional algorithms had little success with. They soon reoriented towards improving empirical results, abandoning attempts to remain true to their biological precursors. ANNs have the ability to learn and model non-linearities and complex relationships. This is achieved by neurons being connected in various patterns, allowing the output of some neurons to become the input of others. The network forms a directed, weighted graph.[112] An artificial neural network consists of simulated neurons. Each neuron is connected to other nodes via links like a biological axon-synapse-dendrite connection. All the nodes connected by links take in some data and use it to perform specific operations and tasks on the data. Each link has a weight, determining the strength of one node's influence on another,[113] allowing weights to choose the signal between neurons. ANNs are composed of artificial neurons which are conceptually derived from biological neurons. Each artificial neuron has inputs and produces a single output which can be sent to multiple other neurons.[114] The inputs can be the feature values of a sample of external data, such as images or documents, or they can be the outputs of other neurons. The outputs of the final output neurons of the neural net accomplish the task, such as recognizing an object in an image. Deep learning Models Artificial neurons To find the output of the neuron we take the weighted sum of all the inputs, weighted by the weights of the connections from the inputs to the neuron. We add a bias term to this sum.[115] This weighted sum is sometimes called the activation. This weighted sum is then passed through a (usually nonlinear) activation function to produce the output. The initial inputs are external data, such as images and documents. The ultimate outputs accomplish the task, such as recognizing an object in an image.[116] The neurons are typically organized into multiple layers, especially in deep learning. Neurons of one layer connect only to neurons of the immediately preceding and immediately following layers. The layer that receives external data is the input layer. The layer that produces the ultimate result is the output layer. In between them are zero or more hidden layers. Single layer and unlayered networks are also used. Between two layers, multiple connection patterns are possible. They can be 'fully connected', with every neuron in one layer connecting to every neuron in the next layer. They can be pooling, where a group of neurons in one layer connects to a single neuron in the next layer, thereby reducing the number of neurons in that layer.[117] Neurons with only such connections form a directed acyclic graph and are known as feedforward networks.[118] Alternatively, networks that allow connections between neurons in the same or previous layers are known as recurrent networks.[119] A hyperparameter is a constant parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. The values of parameters are derived via learning. Examples of hyperparameters include learning rate, the number of hidden layers and batch size. The values of some hyperparameters can be dependent on those of other hyperparameters. For example, the size of some layers can depend on the overall number of layers. Learning is the adaptation of the network to better handle a task by considering sample observations. Learning involves adjusting the weights (and optional thresholds) of the network to improve the accuracy of the result. This is done by minimizing the observed errors. Learning is complete when examining additional observations does not usefully reduce the error rate. Even after learning, the error rate typically does not reach 0. If after learning, the error rate is too high, the network typically must be redesigned. Practically this is done by defining a cost function that is evaluated periodically during learning. As long as its output continues to decline, learning continues. The cost is frequently defined as a statistic whose value can only be approximated. The outputs are actually numbers, so when the error is low, the difference between the output (almost certainly a cat) and the correct answer (cat) is small. Learning attempts to reduce the total of the differences across the observations. Most learning models can be viewed as a straightforward application of optimization theory and statistical estimation.[112][120] The learning rate defines the size of the corrective steps that the model takes to adjust for errors in each observation.[121] A high learning rate shortens the training time, but with lower ultimate accuracy, while a lower learning rate takes longer, but with the potential for greater accuracy. Optimizations such as Quickprop are primarily aimed at speeding up error minimization, while other improvements mainly try to increase reliability. In order to avoid oscillation inside the network such as alternating connection weights, and to improve the rate of convergence, refinements use an adaptive learning rate that increases or decreases as appropriate.[122] The concept of momentum allows the balance between the gradient and the previous change to be weighted such that the weight adjustment depends to some degree on the previous change. A momentum close to 0 emphasizes the gradient, while a value close to 1 emphasizes the last change. While it is possible to define a cost function ad hoc, frequently the choice is determined by the function's desirable properties (such as convexity) or because it arises from the model (e.g. in a probabilistic model the model's posterior probability can be used as an inverse cost).",2
What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"What is Perceptron: A BeginnersTutorial For Perceptron Antony Christopher · Follow 5 min read · May 16, 2021 Listen Share More Perceptron algorithm used in supervised machine learning for classification. There are two types of classification. One will classify the data by drawing a straight line called a linear binary classifier. Another will be cannot classify the data by drawing the straight line called a non-linear binary classifier. Artificial Neuron In Today’s world time is going fast with the same phase of invention too. The AI solution gives a new platform for machines to think like the human brain. The ANN plays a vital role here basically, it functions the same way how the biological neurons work for humans. To make it a simple context, ANN holds two or more input with weighted values and merge them with mathematical function to produce output. Let see how the biological neurons work. Biological Neuron The neuron is the most important function in our human brain. When we sense some activity from the outside the signal is passed to neurons. Once the signal is received from the neuron, produces the respective output. The output is received back to activity as a response. Perceptron The block diagram illustrates the sequence of input as X1, X2, …Xn with their weights as W1, W2…..Wn. Further, calculate the sum of the weights by applying W1*X1+W2*X2+…Wn*Xn. Finally passed the sum of the weights to the activation function. From the function produces the output. Activation Function The activation function is decision-making for neural networks. This function produces a binary output. That’s the reason it’s called a binary step function. The threshold value gets introduced here by validating the value from the weighted sum. If the value is > 0, then applied classification as 1 or True. If the value is < 0, then applied classification as 0 or False. Bias Bias allows you to shift the activation function by adding a constant (i.e. the given bias) to the input. Bias in Neural Networks can be thought of as analogous to the role of a constant in a linear function, whereby the line is effectively transposed by the constant value. In a scenario with bias, the input to the activation function is ‘x’ times the connection weight ‘w0’ plus the bias times the connection weight for the bias ‘w1’. This has the effect of shifting the activation function by a constant amount (b * w1). With all the explanations, I would explain in better understanding in the real-world scenario. Normally, We do prepare tea for our loved ones, especially in the morning. Consider the example ‘Preparing Tea’ as the objective. Consider the example as the perceptron to prepare the good tea. The very first step will be heating the water and pour boiled water into the cup. Add the tea bag and sugar to get the perfect taste of aroma Finally, stir the tea and remove the teabag. If output gives good tea no change. If the output is bad, need to go backward propagation to change the quantity of sugar/water. Then check the output. Here the input is treated as water and weights are considered as teabag & sugar. We need to adjust the weight accordingly, If there is an error occurred in the ouput. Say here as bad tea. Hope you can correlate with the real-world example here. BackPropagation Back-propagation is the essence of neural net training. It is the method of fine- tuning the weights of a neural net based on the error rate obtained in the previous epoch (i.e., iteration). Proper tuning of the weights allows you to reduce error rates and to make the model reliable by increasing its generalization. Perceptron Types Perceptron algorithms can be divided into two types they are single layer perceptrons and multi-layer perceptrons. In a single-layer perceptron’s neurons are organized in one layer whereas in a multilayer perceptron’s a group of neurons will be organized in multiple layers. Every single neuron present in the first layer will take the input signal and send a response to the neurons in the second layer and so on.
