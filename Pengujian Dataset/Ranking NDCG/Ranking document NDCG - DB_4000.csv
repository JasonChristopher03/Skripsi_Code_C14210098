What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"subparts and see what each of them are, how they work, and how each one of them is used in real life. Starting with Supervised Learning, So what is it? Understanding Supervised Learning Let’s see the mathematical definition of Supervised Learning. Supervised learning is the one where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output. it, Y = f(X) The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that whenever you get some new input data (x), the machine can easily predict the output variables (Y) for that data. Let me rephrase you this in simple terms: In Supervised machine learning algorithm, every instance of the training dataset consists of input attributes and expected output. The training dataset can take any kind of data as input like values of a database row, the pixels of an image, or even an audio frequency histogram. Now let me tell you why this category of machine learning is termed as supervised learning? This category is termed as supervised learning because the process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher teaching his students. The algorithm continuously predicts the result on the basis of training data and is continuously corrected by the teacher. The learning continues until the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance. Supervised Learning Use-cases Cortana Cortana or any speech automated system in your mobile phone trains your voice and then starts working based on this training. This is an application of Supervised Learning Weather Apps Predicts the upcoming weather by analyzing the parameters for a given time on some prior knowledge (when its sunny, temperature is higher; when its cloudy, humidity is higher, etc.). Biometric Attendance In Biometric Attendance you can train the machine with inputs of your biometric identity — it can be your thumb, iris or ear-lobe, etc. Once the machine is trained it can validate your future input and can easily identify you. Understanding Unsupervised Learning So, what is Unsupervised Learning? Mathematically, Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data. Let me rephrase it for you in simple terms: In the unsupervised learning approach, the sample of a training dataset does not have an expected output associated with them. Using the unsupervised learning algorithms you can detect patterns based on the typical characteristics of the input data. Clustering can be considered as an example of a machine learning task that uses the unsupervised learning approach. The machine then groups similar data samples and identify different clusters within the data. Now let me tell you why this category of machine learning is known as unsupervised learning? Well, this category of machine learning is known as unsupervised because unlike supervised learning there is no teacher. Algorithms are left on their own to discover and return the interesting structure in the data. Unsupervised Learning Usecases A friend invites you to his party where you meet totally strangers. Now you will classify them using unsupervised learning (no prior knowledge) and this classification can be on the basis of gender, age group, dressing, educational qualification or whatever way you would like. Since you didn’t have any prior knowledge about people and so you just classified them “on-the-go”. Let’s suppose you have never seen a Football match before and by chance watch a video on the internet, now you can classify players on the basis of different criterion like Players wearing the same sort of kits are in one class, Players of one style are in one class (players, goalkeeper, referee), or on the basis of playing style(attacker or defender) or whatever way you would observe,",2
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"Let’s break down three key types of machine learning in a way that’s easy to follow. Unsupervised learning is when the computer doesn’t get any labels. It’s like being given a set of puzzles with no instructions. The computer’s job is to find patterns and group similar things together. For example, it might look at a bunch of animal photos and group them based on common traits, even if it doesn’t know the names. The great thing about this approach is that it’s perfect for discovering hidden patterns. The downside? The computer might group things in ways that don’t always make sense to us. Supervised learning is like learning with a teacher who gives you both questions and answers. Imagine showing a computer a bunch of images labeled “cat” or “dog.” The machine looks for patterns, learning what makes each animal unique. Over time, it can predict whether new pictures show cats or dogs, based on the patterns it’s seen. The big advantage? It’s fast because the computer has clear guidance. The downside? You need a lot of labeled data, which can take time to prepare. Reinforcement learning is more like a game. The computer learns by trying actions and receiving feedback — rewards for good choices, penalties for mistakes. Think of training a robot to navigate a maze. It tries different paths, and each time it hits a wall, it learns to avoid that route next time. The benefit here is that it can learn complex tasks over time. The challenge? It takes a lot of trial and error for the computer to figure out the best approach. Supervised Learning: Guided Learning with Answers Reinforcement Learning: Learning by Trying and Failing Unsupervised Learning: Figuring Things Out on Your Own Now you see how these different approaches make machines smarter. From helping us find better movie recommendations to improving game AI, machine learning is part of our everyday lives. What’s a piece of technology that has impressed you recently with how smart it seems? I’d love to hear about it!",2
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is simply the strategy of making a machine learn from data. When going deep, we can say that Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers the ability to learn and improve on their own experience without being explicitly programmed. Mainly there are three types of methods in which machine learning algorithms learn. They are… Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning Reinforcement Learning In a supervised learning process, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions called the labels. This means, there are already some data that consist of the desired answers or output in the dataset itself. Let’s understand the concept of supervised learning with an example, take the case of a five-year-old student, he/she is not likely to understand the subjects without the help of his/her teacher. So there he/she needs a supervisor for learning the subjects. In the same way, our supervised learning algorithm is also like a five-year-old child which cannot learn without the help of a supervisor. So to make a model more Supervised Learning efficient, we need to train them continuously with the labeled training data to yield a good result. After the algorithm learns the rules and patterns of the data, it creates a model which is an algorithmic equation for producing output data with the rules and patterns derived from training data. Here we are giving all labels to the algorithm to predict the outcome. Once the algorithm is well trained with the data it can be launched in the real world. important supervised learning algorithms: Linear Regression Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines(SVM) k-Nearest Neighbors Decision Tree & Random Forests Neural Networks Supervised Learning Model Unsupervised Learning Important Unsupervised Learning algorithms Important Unsupervised learning algorithms: Clustering K-Means DBSCAN Hierarchical Cluster Analysis(HCA) Anomaly detection and novelty detection One-class-SVM Isolation Forest In unsupervised learning, the data patterns are not classified. Instead, the algorithm tries to uncover the hidden patterns in a dataset and create labels. This means the unsupervised learning algorithms are able to classify the overall data into groups of data that are quite similar in their features. Suppose you want to identify which type of customers are mostly attracted to your products, you can classify them into different groups using unsupervised learning algorithms based on their purchasing behavior and can identify which type of customers are most attracted to your product. In industry, unsupervised learning is particularly powerful in fraud detection where the most dangerous attacks are often those yet to be classified. Moreover, it is used in spam filtering, fraudulent transactions, fraudulent online activities, etc. Unsupervised Learning Model Association rule learning Apriori Eclat Visualization and dimensionality reduction Principal Component Analysis(PCA) Kernal PCA Locally-Linear Embedding(LLE) t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding(t-SNE) Reinforcement Learning One of the most advanced learning approaches in Machine Learning is Reinforcement learning. Unlike supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning is a sophisticated learning technique that continuously improves its model by leveraging feedback from previous iterations. The learning system is called an agent which gets rewards for good performance and penalties for bad performance. At each time the machine can understand which type of strategy is the best fit to get the rewards and to keep away from penalties. The method of reinforcement learning is used to train robots how to walk, jump, run, etc. Conclusion Supervised and Unsupervised learning is mostly used in industries to build smart systems. Moreover, these algorithms can also be used to create insights on data that are quite useful for data scientists when working on",3
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"1 : Defining problem and gathering data for it. Step 2 : Pre-processing data. Step 3 : Split data into train and test sets. Step 4 : Training the model. Step 5 : Evaluating model. Step 6 : Improve model. Step 7 : Deploying model and monitoring. Steps 4, 5 and 6 are repeated until we get some satisfactory conclusion, we can use that algorithm else we will try improving our algorithm up to satisfactory results. Once our model is trained at satisfactory result we will use in real time data. 2. Unsupervised Learning In unsupervised learning, machine is presented with unlabeled, uncategorized data and the system’s algorithms act on the data without prior training. System will figure out pattern of data and group them in that manner. For example, in above example of apples and strawberries we will not label data, i.e. we will not say system that this is an apple or a strawberry. Hey...! It still identified correctly. But, how? They grouped data based on similarity. It is like giving a baby a bunch of fruits and giving no prior knowledge of which fruits they are. In this case baby will group similar looking fruits, same as our system did above. In short it will form clusters of similar data. So clustering is type of unsupervised ML. Clustering: A clustering problem is where system tries to discover the inherent groupings in the data. Like in our above example. 3. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement Learning is a part of Machine learning where an agent is put in an environment and he learns to behave in this environment by performing certain actions and observing the rewards which it gets from those actions. Best example of this is playing a new game. At the first you are totally unaware about the features of game. But once you start exploring you get to learn and with the passing time you become a champion. Is it? Similarly, system or agent here is put out in different environments with some initial algorithms. The agent explores environment and learns the same way you did playing a new game. Another example could be a child going to school. Here the child is agent, school would be the environment. If a child does some good work he will be rewarded, but if he misbehaves, he will be punished or penalized. In future, whenever child will try to do similar thing again he will think of getting rewarded or punished. This will improve the child. Reinforcement Learning is mostly used in gaming, finance sector, manufacturing, Inventory management, Robot navigation, etc. Flow chart recap for Types of Machine Learnings: This is all about introduction to machine learning and it’s different types.

What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"classified as class X because the majority of our neighbors are members of that class. This classification can be accomplished with simple majority vote or distance-weighted voting [10]. B. Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning deals with input data that are not labeled at all. The input is unsorted information or data and we do not have any idea, clue or guidance about the input characteristics and features. In this case, grouping can be processed based on the shape, differences, similarities and different patterns of the data. In terms of complexity, it is a computationally complex model. Unlike supervised learning, the number of classes is unknown. Unsupervised learning can be used for clustering, feature learning, anomaly detection, Fig. 4. Overview of the KNN algorithm, outlining the steps involved in categorizing an unclassified data point based on majority voting from its nearest neighbors [11]. and dimensionality reduction [6]. Clustering is one of the important types of un-supervised machine learning algorithms which group and categorize unlabeled data. It is similar to classification, but the only difference is in the dataset. In classification we are dealing with labeled data but in clus- tering we are working with un-labeled dataset. To provide a clearer understanding of this concept, the general framework of clustering is shown in Fig. 7 (b). K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm which is working based on randomly initializing the centroids, computing the distances among given data points and centroids, and assigning the sample points to the new clusters. The main steps of the k-means clustering are depicted in Fig. 5 [12]. Fig. 5. Key steps of the K-Means clustering algorithm, illustrating the process of grouping data points into distinct clusters based on their features. In Fig. 6, we try to find the best place to separate the image after filtering with k-means clustering method. The images have been collected from Kaggle [13]. In this method as briefly 4 described in [14], we can use the final image in the form of a matrix. We select several random starting points in the matrix. Using the k-means method, we divide the points inside the image into several clusters [14]. The center point of each cluster can also be considered as the center of each character. Fig. 6. Samples of segmentations based on k-means clustering C. Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning (RL) is another subset of machine learning in which the agents are allowed to learn from their own experiences and errors in an environment leading to maximized total cumulative reward and making a balance between exploration and exploitation which are the main goals of RL [15]. As it is mentioned above, the main aim of unsuper- vised learning is to deal with unsorted data, differences, and similarities among them. Also, the main target in supervised learning is dealing with labeled data for better prediction and classification. The framework of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning are depicted in Fig. 7. D. Semi-supervised Learning Some drawbacks in supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms like manually labeling the data and limited spec- trum of applications, respectively [16] are the main motiva- tions of developing semi-supervised learning. In this type of learning, we are dealing with both labeled and unlabeled data. As seen in Fig. 8, the initial step here is clustering based on the similarity in the input data. It means that unsupervised learning is used first to cluster similar data and use it to train the model. Then this information can be used to label the remaining unlabeled data [6]. This process is called pseudo-labeling. Next, train the model based on these combined labeled and pseudo-labeled data [6][16] which results in prediction with better accuracy. E.

What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"Preprint submitted to the 6th ASMO UK / ISSMO conference.

Sienz†  †University of Wales Swansea, Centre for Polymer Processing Simulation and Design, C2EC  Research Centre, Swansea, SA2 8PP, Wales-UK.  mauroinnocente@yahoo.com.ar              J.Sienz@swansea.ac.uk  Keywords: optimization, particle swarm, evolutionary algorithm, parameters’ tuning, stopping criteria, constraint- handling Abstract  For problems where the quality of any solution can be  quantified in a numerical value, optimization is the process of  finding the permitted combination of variables in the problem  that optimizes that value. Traditional methods present a very  restrictive range of applications, mainly limited by the features  of the function to be optimized and of the constraint functions.  In contrast, evolutionary algorithms present almost no  restriction to the features of these functions, although the most  appropriate constraint-handling technique is still an open  question. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is  sometimes viewed as another evolutionary algorithm because  of their many similarities, despite not being inspired by the  same metaphor. Namely, they evolve a population of  individuals taking into consideration previous experiences and  using stochastic operators to introduce new responses. The  advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to  traditional methods have been greatly discussed in the  literature for decades. While all such advantages are valid  when comparing the PSO paradigm to traditional methods, its  main advantages with respect to evolutionary algorithms  consist of its noticeably lower computational cost and easier  implementation. In fact, the plain version can be programmed  in a few lines of code, involving no operator design and few  parameters to be tuned. This paper deals with three important  aspects of the method: the influence of the parameters’ tuning  on the behaviour of the system; the design of stopping criteria  so that the reliability of the solution found can be somehow  estimated and computational cost can be saved; and the  development of appropriate techniques to handle constraints,  given that the original method is designed for unconstrained  optimization problems.  INTRODUCTION  Optimization is the process of seeking the combination  of variables that leads to the best performance of the  model, where “best” is measured according to a pre- defined criterion, usually subject to a set of constraints.  Thus, setting different combinations of values of the  “variables” allows trying different candidate solutions,  the “constraints” limit the valid combinations, and the  “optimality criterion” allows differentiating better from  worse. Traditional optimization methods exhibit several  weaknesses such as a number of requirements that either  the function to be optimized or the constraint functions  must comply with for the technique to be applicable,  and their usual incapability of escaping local optima.  Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) comprise a number of  techniques developed along the last few decades, which  are inspired by evolution processes that natural  organisms undergo to adapt to a dynamic environment  in order to survive. Since these organisms adapt by  seeking the best response to the challenge they are  facing, they happen to perform complex optimization  processes, which can be viewed as processes of fitness  maximization. It is important to remark that, since they  do not specifically intend to perform optimization but to  adapt to the environment, it is frequently claimed that  they are not “optimization” but “adaptation” methods. It  turns out that such adaptation results in optimizing the  fitness of the individuals. Although these methods  typically require higher computational resources than  traditional methods, they do not impose",1
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"A particle swarm searching for the global minimum of a function Particle swarm optimization In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO)[1] is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search- space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions. PSO is originally attributed to Kennedy, Eberhart and Shi[2][3] and was first intended for simulating social behaviour,[4] as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The book by Kennedy and Eberhart[5] describes many philosophical aspects of PSO and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of PSO applications is made by Poli.[6][7] In 2017, a comprehensive review on theoretical and experimental works on PSO has been published by Bonyadi and Michalewicz.[1] PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. Also, PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi- newton methods. However, metaheuristics such as PSO do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found. A basic variant of the PSO algorithm works by having a population (called a swarm) of candidate solutions (called particles). These particles are moved around in the search-space according to a few simple formulae.[8] The movements of the particles are guided by their own best-known position in the search-space as well as the entire swarm's best-known position. When improved positions are being discovered these will then come to guide the movements of the swarm. The process is repeated and by doing so it is hoped, but not guaranteed, that a satisfactory solution will eventually be discovered. Formally, let f:  ℝn  → ℝ be the cost function which must be minimized. The function takes a candidate solution as an argument in the form of a vector of real numbers and produces a real number as output which indicates the objective function value of the given candidate solution. The Algorithm Performance landscape showing how a simple PSO variant performs in aggregate on several benchmark problems when varying two PSO parameters. gradient of f is not known. The goal is to find a solution a for which f(a) ≤ f(b) for all b in the search-space, which would mean a is the global minimum. Let S be the number of particles in the swarm, each having a position xi ∈ ℝn in the search-space and a velocity vi ∈ ℝn. Let pi be the best known position of particle i and let g be the best known position of the entire swarm. A basic PSO algorithm to minimize the cost function is then:[9] for each particle i = 1, ..., S do     Initialize the particle's position with a uniformly distributed random vector: xi ~ U(blo, bup)     Initialize the particle's best known position to its initial position: pi ← xi     if f(pi) < f(g) then         update the swarm's best known position: g ← pi     Initialize the particle's velocity: vi ~ U(-|bup-blo|, |bup-blo|) while a termination criterion is not met do:     for each particle i = 1, ..., S do         for each dimension d = 1, ..., n do             Pick random numbers: rp, rg ~ U(0,1)             Update the particle's velocity: vi,d ← w vi,d + φp rp (pi,d-xi,d) + φg rg",3
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"Preprint submitted to Trends in Engineering Computational Technology  doi:10.4203/csets.20.6  1  Abstract    The advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to traditional methods have  been greatly discussed in the literature. While particle swarm optimizers share such  advantages, they outperform evolutionary algorithms in that they require lower  computational cost and easier implementation, involving no operator design and few  coefficients to be tuned. However, even marginal variations in the settings of these  coefficients greatly influence the dynamics of the swarm. Since this paper does not  intend to study their tuning, general-purpose settings are taken from previous stud- ies, and virtually the same algorithm is used to optimize a variety of notably differ- ent problems. Thus, following a review of the paradigm, the algorithm is tested on a  set of benchmark functions and engineering problems taken from the literature. Lat- er, complementary lines of code are incorporated to adapt the method to combinato- rial optimization as it occurs in scheduling problems, and a real case is solved using  the same optimizer with the same settings. The aim is to show the flexibility and ro- bustness of the approach, which can handle a wide variety of problems.    Keywords: Particle Swarms, Artificial Intelligence, Optimization, Scheduling.    1  Introduction    The characteristics of the objective variables, the function to be optimized and the  constraint functions severely restrict the applicability of traditional optimization al- gorithms. The variables and both the objective and constraint functions must comply  with a number of requirements for a given traditional method to be applicable. Fur- thermore, traditional methods are typically prone to converge towards local optima.  By contrast, population-based methods such as evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and  particle swarm optimization (PSO) are general-purpose optimizers, which are able to  handle different types of variables and functions with few or no adaptations.

The lack of limitations to the features of the varia- bles and functions that model the problem enable these methods to handle models  whose high complexity does not allow traditional, deterministic, analytical ap- proaches. While the advantages of PSO and EAs with respect to traditional methods  are roughly the same, the main advantages of PSO when compared to EAs are its  lower computational cost and easier implementation. Regarding their drawbacks,  both these methods require higher computational effort, some constraint-handling  technique incorporated, and find it hard to handle equality constraints.    Population-based methods like EAs and PSO are considered modern heuristics  because they are not designed to optimize a given problem deterministically but to  carry out some procedures that are not directly related to the optimization problem.  Optimization occurs without evident links between the implemented technique and  the resulting optimization process. They are also viewed as Artificial Intelligence  (AI) techniques because their ability to optimize is an emergent property that is not  specifically intended, and therefore not implemented in the code. Thus, the problem  per se is not analytically solved, but",0
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"registration methods use the intensity values of the pixels in the images to register the images. One common approach is to use Mutual Information (MI), which is a measure of the statistical dependence between the intensity values in the two images. Normalized Mutual Informa- tion (NMI) improves the robustness of MI by avoiding some mis-registrations by being independent of overlapping areas of the two datasets. Feature-based Registration methods aim to ﬁnd the transformation that minimizes the distance between the features extracted from the datasets to be aligned. The features are geometrical entities, with the most commonly used ones being points, lines or contours [4]. Springer Nature 2021 LATEX template PSO for 3D medical image registration 3 3 Particle Swarm Optimization The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is a population-based opti- mization algorithm, proposed by Kennedy and Eberhart in 1995 [2]. It is inspired by the behavior of swarms in nature. It works by iteratively improv- ing a candidate solution by adjusting the values of the variables in the solution based on the experiences of the ”particles” in the swarm. The algorithm consists of a population of particles, each of which represents a potential solution to the optimization problem. Each particle has a position in the search space and a velocity, which determines how the particle moves through the search space. The particles are initialized at random positions in the search space, and the velocity of each particle is initialized to a small value. At each iteration of the algorithm, each particle updates its position and velocity based on its current position, the best position it has found so far (referred to as the ”personal best” position), and the best position found by any particle in the swarm (referred to as the ”global best” position). The position and velocity of each particle are updated according to the following equations: V (t + 1) = wV (t) + c1r1(PBest(t) −P(t)) + c2r2(GBest(t) −P(t)) (1) P(t + 1) = P(t) + V (t + 1) (2) where: V is the velocity, P is the position of the particle, t is the current iteration, w is the inertia weight, which determines how much the particle’s current velocity aﬀects its new velocity, c1 and c2 are constants that control the inﬂuence of the personal best and global best positions on the particle’s velocity, r1 and r2 are random numbers between 0 and 1, PBest(t) is the best position the particle has found so far, GBest(t) is the best position found by any particle in the swarm. The algorithm continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum number of iterations or a satisfactory solution being found. PSO is a simple and eﬀective optimization algorithm that has been applied to a wide range of problems in various ﬁelds. It is easy to implement and can ﬁnd solutions quickly, making it a popular choice for many optimization problems. Several variants of the original PSO has been proposed. In this review we will investigate if the standard PSO algorithm has been used or its variants. See Nayak et al. [7] for an in-depth analysis of PSO, its variants and its applications, and Gad [8] for a systemtic review on PSO, that also outlines previous review studies. 4 Methodology and Results We applied the systematic review methodology of Brereton et al.

What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"in metals — slowly cooling down a material to reduce defects. In optimization, simulated annealing starts with random solutions and makes changes, accepting worse solutions early on (just like how high temperatures allow for more flexibility in metals) and gradually reducing the acceptance rate as the temperature cools. Both SA and EAs use randomness to explore the solution space, but the key difference is that EAs work with populations of solutions, while SA focuses on improving a single solution over time. SA is more straightforward but might miss out on the broader exploration that EAs achieve by working with multiple solutions at once. Particle Swarm Optimization vs Evolutionary Algorithms Now, let’s talk about Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) — another population- based technique. PSO is inspired by how birds flock together or how fish swim in schools. It’s like the members of the population, or “particles,” fly through the solution space, guided by both their own experience and the knowledge of the entire swarm. You can think of it as a cooperative strategy where each particle adjusts its position based on its own “best-known position” and the “best-known position” of its neighbors. How does this compare to EAs? While both use a population to search the solution space, PSO focuses more on swarm intelligence, where particles share information to improve the whole group. EAs, on the other hand, rely on evolutionary principles — selection, crossover, and mutation — to evolve the population over generations. PSO can be faster because it doesn’t perform crossover or mutation, but EAs can be more effective in highly complex and rugged landscapes due to their genetic diversity. Applications of Evolutionary Algorithms You might be thinking: “Okay, I get the theory — but where do evolutionary algorithms actually shine in the real world?” Well, EAs are incredibly versatile, and their applications range from engineering to creative arts. Let’s break it down. Optimization in Engineering In engineering, optimization problems are everywhere — from designing aerodynamics to optimizing structures for strength and weight. Evolutionary algorithms are particularly useful when the solution space is vast and filled with constraints. For instance, when optimizing the shape of an airplane wing, traditional methods might struggle to balance conflicting requirements (like lift vs. drag). EAs can explore different designs, evolving solutions over time to find a balance that meets all objectives. You’ll also see EAs used in control system design, manufacturing processes, and mechanical optimization, where the number of variables and constraints make it difficult to use conventional techniques. Machine Learning If you’ve ever struggled with hyperparameter tuning in machine learning, evolutionary algorithms might just be your savior. You can use EAs to evolve neural network architectures — a process known as neuroevolution. Instead of manually designing the network structure, the EA searches for the best architecture by tweaking the number of layers, neurons, and connections. This is especially helpful when you’re working with deep learning models that have tons of hyperparameters to optimize. EAs can also be applied to evolve decision trees, tune parameters in support vector machines, or optimize any machine learning algorithm where the search space is large and complex. Artificial Creativity This might surprise you: EAs aren’t just for technical fields — they can be used to generate art and music. In evolutionary art, an algorithm evolves visual images by mutating and combining different designs until an aesthetically pleasing result is achieved. Similarly, in music, evolutionary algorithms can be used to compose melodies by evolving musical structures based on user feedback or predefined fitness criteria. You’re essentially “breeding” creativity, evolving novel patterns that might never have been imagined otherwise. Some artists and researchers",0
How is AI used in everyday life?,"life is generated where the automated machines work for humans, saving their time and energy. Basically, two types of assistants are considered for humans, manual (in the form of robots), and digital (Chatbots) which can perform risky, repetitive, and troublesome tasks. The task of developing such machines is accomplished by minutely studying the human behavior and implementing the logic in the form of algorithms resulting in inventions of software, devices, robots, etc., making human race smarter. There are many areas which contribute to artiﬁcial intelligence which includes mathematics (used for developing algorithms), biology, philosophy, psychology, neuroscience (for studying human mind and its behavior), statistics (for handling huge data), and last but not the least, computer science (to run the algorithm for implementing the concepts). The basic aim of AI is to provide more transparent, interpretable, and explainable systems which can help to establish a better-equipped system used as an intelligent agent. The concept of trusting machine as a replica of human started with the invent of turing test in which the machine is tested irrespective of the knowledge of examiner upon the instructions given considering it as human and if it passes the test, the machine is considered as intelligent. No wonder AI has affected many aspects of the society and presented a new modern era in this digital revolution. 1.1 Types of AI (Based on Capabilities) The various types of artiﬁcial intelligence based on the capabilities can be classiﬁed as – Weak or narrow AI – General AI – Strong AI. Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 25 Weak or narrow AI: it is a type of AI which can perform a predeﬁned narrow set of instructions without exhibiting any thinking capability. It is the most widely used type of AI in this world. Some famous examples are Apples’s Siri, Alexa, Alpha Go, IBM’s Watson supercomputer, Sophia (the humanoid) all belong to the weak AI type [3]. General AI: it is the type of AI which can perform the tasks like what human can do. Till now it is not achieved, there are no such machines which works like human or can think as perfectly as human, but it may happen in near future. Strong AI: it is the type of AI in which it is expected that the machine will surpass the capacity of human. It will perform better than humans, though it is tough, but it is not impossible. It may be the situation when it can be said that the machines will be the master and overtake humans. It has been considered as a great threat to the society by scientists including Stephen Hawking. 1.2 Types of AI (Based on Functionality) Based on the functionality, artiﬁcial intelligence can be classiﬁed as per the following types: (i) Reactive machines (ii) Limited memory (iii) Theory of mind (iv) Self-awareness. Reactive machines: these are the machines which works on the data available in the form of predeﬁned dataset. It does not have the facility of data storage for storing the past and future data. It completely depends on the present data. IBM’s chess program which defeated famous champion Garry Kasparov and the deep blue system, Google’s AlphaGo are some of the examples for reactive machines [3]. Limited memory: these are the machines which can store the past experience or store the memory for limited period of time. An example for limited memory AI is the self-driving cars (it can store the information like speed, distance, speed limit required for the navigation of the car). Theory of mind: these are types of machines, which are expected to understand the psychological and emotional aspects of human mind and work accordingly. So far such machines are a dream but scientists are working to develop such machines in near future. Self-awareness: these machines belong to a hypothetical concept that will be consid- ered as super-intelligent machines, which can think, act, and will be self-aware as they will have consciousness and sentiments like humans.",0
How is AI used in everyday life?,"AI can be categorized into two main types: 1. Narrow AI (or Weak AI): This type of AI is programmed to perform a narrow task like facial recognition, internet searches, or driving a car. Most of the AI encountered in day-to-day life, from chatbots to virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, falls under this category. Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a frontier in computer science, aiming to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. In essence, AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It’s related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to biologically observable methods. Defining AI The definition of AI is often a topic of debate, but at its core, it involves machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include planning, understanding language, recognizing objects and sounds, learning, and problem solving. We can consider AI to be a system that perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Brief History of AI AI as a concept has been around for centuries, with roots in Greek mythology. Modern AI, however, began in the 20th century with the development of the Turing Test by Alan Turing, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called “intelligent.” The field of AI research was formally founded at a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956. Types of AI Recently in technology, two terms frequently come up: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Often used interchangeably, these terms actually describe different, though closely related, concepts in the realm of computer science. The goal of this article is to explain these concepts in a simple, straightforward manner, making them accessible to those with little or no existing knowledge in the field. I aim to provide a clear understanding of both AI and ML, how they work, and what differentiates them. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? 2. General AI (or Strong AI): This is a type of AI that has a broader range and is more akin to human cognition. It can intelligently solve a variety of problems, learn new tasks, and perform a variety of tasks. General AI is still a largely theoretical concept, with no existing examples as of now. As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, ethical considerations are increasingly important. Issues like privacy, security, and the potential impact on employment are significant topics of discussion. Ensuring that AI benefits society while minimizing its risks is a challenge that needs ongoing attention. The Future of AI The future of AI promises advancements in various fields and the potential to solve complex global challenges. However, it also poses significant challenges and risks that need to be managed responsibly. Various technologies are used in AI, including: 1. Machine Learning: Allowing machines to learn from data. 2. Natural Language Processing: Enabling machines to understand and interact with human language. 3. Robotics: The field of creating robots that can perform tasks in the physical world. 4. Neural Networks: Computer systems modeled on the human brain and nervous system. AI is now a part of everyday life and is used in a range of sectors. For example, in healthcare, AI is used to predict patient risk and improve diagnostics. In finance, it’s used for algorithmic trading and risk management. In the consumer sector, AI powers personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, as well as recommendation systems used by companies like Netflix and Amazon.

Now, lets look into what each term means. What is AI, ML, and DL? AI: Developing machines to mimic human intelligence and behavior Artificial intelligence is the broad idea that machines can intelligently execute tasks by mimicking human behaviors and thought process using algorithms, data, and models. AI predicts, automates, and complete tasks typically done by humans with greater accuracy and precision, reduces bias, cost and timesaving. What is learning? We learn things in certain ways. How do human generally learn? Remember, generalize and keep adapting to changing things. We will incorporate these things into machines. ML: Algorithms that learn from structured data to predict output and discover patterns in that data. Machine learning, a subset of AI, revolves around the idea that machines can learn and adapt through experiences and data to complete specific tasks. This uses methods from statistics, operational research, and physics to find hidden insights within data without being programmed where to look or what to conclude. Machine learning is used to develop self-learning processing where software is given instructions on accomplishing a specific task. An example would be predicting the weather forecast for the next seven days based on data from previous year and previous week. Every day, the data from the previous year/week changes, so the ML model must adapt to the new data. 8/12/24, 11:00 AM Introduction to AI.

Deep learning is a subset of ML. It is a evolution of machine learning and neural networks which uses advanced computer programming and training to understand complex patterns hidden in large dataset. DL is about understanding how the human brain works in different situations and then trying to recreate its behaviour. For example, deep learning (combined with computer vision) in a driverless car can identify a person crossing the road. Also, used for complicated problems such as facial recognition, defect detection and image processing. We will discuss examples regarding which type of situations to use ML/DL and the benefits of using one over the other in the following sections. When to use AI?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the science of making machines smart using algorithms to help computers solve problems, which used to be solved only by humans. Most AI examples that you hear about today — like chatboxes to self-driving cars — rely heavily on deep learning and machine learning. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data. A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence AI is not as modern as we think it is. AI dates all the way back to 1950 when Alan Turing created the Turing test. Later in the 1960s, ELIZA, the first chatbot program, was created. A chess computer was made by IBM in 1977, and it beat a world chess champion in two of its six games, while the champion won one, and the other three were all drawn. Apple introduced Siri as its digital assistant in 2011. Elon Musk and some others founded OpenAI in 2015. Different Types of Artificial Intelligence There are several of AI as outlined below: Analytic AI By using machine learning, including deep learning, one of the most advanced methods available, analytical AI can scan thousands of data points to uncover patterns and dependencies, ultimately assisting businesses in making informed decisions. Among the many applications of analytic AI are sentiment analysis and supplier risk assessment. Functional AI The purpose of functional AI is very similar to analytic AI — it scans vast amounts of data and tries to identify patterns and dependencies among them. Unlike analytic AI, functional AI takes actions rather than making recommendations. Using sensor data from a specific machine, an IoT cloud can, for instance, spot a pattern of potential machine breakdowns and act on it. A second example is the robots that Amazon employs to move the goods from the shelves to the pickers, thus speeding up the picking process. Interactive AI Businesses can automate communication with this type of AI without compromising on interaction. This type of AI can be visualized by imagining chatbots and smart personal assistants that can answer pre-programmed questions and understand the context of conversations. A company’s internal processes can be improved by using interactive AI. Text AI The use of Text AI can offer businesses the ability to recognize texts, convert speech to text, and translate content. This type of AI can be utilized even by companies that are not Google, Amazon, or any other giant companies that offer text AI services. An internal corporate knowledge base can be powered by text AI, for instance. When compared with a traditional knowledge base, which relies on keyword searching, an AI-enabled one can locate documents containing the most relevant information even if they do not contain keywords. AI can build semantic maps from natural language processing and recognize synonyms to understand the context of the user’s question thanks to semantic search and natural language processing. Visual AI Businesses can transform images and videos into insights by using visual AI to identify, recognize, classify, and sort objects. As an example, a machine that grades apples according to their colour and size or one that helps insurers estimate damage with damaged car photos constitutes visual AI. Computer vision and augmented reality are areas in which this type of AI can be applied. Self-awareness AI systems that are self-aware are among the lesser-known types of AI that currently exist only in theory. The ultimate goal of AI is to reach this phase. This technology would be explored and developed with the intention of achieving this phase of consciousness. Artificial intelligence systems that are self-aware would be so advanced and so in tune with the human brain that they would have a sufficient degree of self-",3

For business owners, managers, and curious beginners, understanding the fundamentals of AI is essential for making informed decisions and harnessing its potential to drive growth and innovation. In this article, we will delve deep into the world of AI, exploring its core principles, practical applications, and future implications. Understanding Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that traditionally require human intelligence. The field includes various subfields, each with its own focus and application. Machine learning is one such subfield, where algorithms enable computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. Natural language processing focuses on enabling machines to understand and interact with human language, while computer vision enables machines to interpret and understand visual information. Robotics combines AI with physical systems to create intelligent machines capable of interacting with the physical world. Machine Learning: The Essence of AI Machine learning, a subset of AI, lies at the heart of many AI applications. It allows computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without explicit programming. Machine learning algorithms identify patterns and relationships within data, extract meaningful insights, and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. This ability to learn from experience enables machines to automate tasks, recognize speech, classify images, and more. Machine learning is a fundamental subset of AI that plays a crucial role in enabling computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. It provides machines with the ability to automatically learn patterns, make predictions, and make decisions without explicit programming. In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled examples to make predictions or classifications. It is provided with a dataset where each data point is associated with a target value or label. The algorithm analyzes the features of the data and learns to map them to the corresponding target value. This allows the algorithm to make accurate predictions or classifications for new, unseen data. For example, in a spam email classification system, the algorithm is trained on a dataset of labeled emails, where each email is classified as either spam or non-spam. By analyzing the features of the emails, such as the words used or the presence of certain keywords, the algorithm learns to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. Once trained, it can accurately classify new emails as spam or non-spam. Unsupervised learning, on the other hand, involves learning from unlabeled data, where the algorithm is not provided with any target labels. The algorithm analyzes the patterns and structures in the data to discover inherent relationships and groupings. Clustering algorithms are commonly used in unsupervised learning to group similar data points together. For example, in customer segmentation, an unsupervised learning algorithm can analyze customer data based on various attributes and group customers into segments based on their similarities. Reinforcement learning is a different paradigm of machine learning where an agent learns to interact with an environment and takes actions to maximize a reward signal. The agent learns through trial and error, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions. It explores the environment, learns which actions yield higher rewards, and adjusts its behavior accordingly. Reinforcement learning has been",3
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Heuristic (computer science) In mathematical optimization and computer science, heuristic (from Greek εὑρίσκω ""I find, discover""[1]) is a technique designed for problem solving more quickly when classic methods are too slow for finding an exact or approximate solution, or when classic methods fail to find any exact solution in a search space. This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for speed. In a way, it can be considered a shortcut. A heuristic function, also simply called a heuristic, is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow. For example, it may approximate the exact solution.[2] The objective of a heuristic is to produce a solution in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem at hand. This solution may not be the best of all the solutions to this problem, or it may simply approximate the exact solution. But it is still valuable because finding it does not require a prohibitively long time. Heuristics may produce results by themselves, or they may be used in conjunction with optimization algorithms to improve their efficiency (e.g., they may be used to generate good seed values). Results about NP-hardness in theoretical computer science make heuristics the only viable option for a variety of complex optimization problems that need to be routinely solved in real-world applications. Heuristics underlie the whole field of Artificial Intelligence and the computer simulation of thinking, as they may be used in situations where there are no known algorithms.[3] The trade-off criteria for deciding whether to use a heuristic for solving a given problem include the following: Optimality: When several solutions exist for a given problem, does the heuristic guarantee that the best solution will be found? Is it actually necessary to find the best solution? Completeness: When several solutions exist for a given problem, can the heuristic find them all? Do we actually need all solutions? Many heuristics are only meant to find one solution. Accuracy and precision: Can the heuristic provide a confidence interval for the purported solution? Is the error bar on the solution unreasonably large? Execution time: Is this the best-known heuristic for solving this type of problem? Some heuristics converge faster than others. Some heuristics are only marginally quicker than classic Definition and motivation Trade-off methods, in which case the 'overhead' on calculating the heuristic might have a negative impact. In some cases, it may be difficult to decide whether the solution found by the heuristic is good enough because the theory underlying heuristics is not very elaborate. One way of achieving the computational performance gain expected of a heuristic consists of solving a simpler problem whose solution is also a solution to the initial problem. An example of approximation is described by Jon Bentley for solving the travelling salesman problem (TSP): ""Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"" so as to select the order to draw using a pen plotter. TSP is known to be NP-hard so an optimal solution for even a moderate size problem is difficult to solve. Instead, the greedy algorithm can be used to give a good but not optimal solution (it is an approximation to the optimal answer) in a reasonably short amount of time. The greedy algorithm heuristic says to pick whatever is currently the best next step regardless of whether that prevents (or even makes impossible) good steps later. It is a heuristic in the sense that practice indicates it is a good enough solution, while theory indicates that there are better solutions (and even indicates how much better, in some cases).[4] Another example of heuristic making an algorithm faster occurs in certain search",2
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Heuristic algorithms are techniques often used in the field of computer science and programming to achieve reasonably good solutions in a reasonable amount of time, especially when dealing with complex problems. In this article, we will discuss how heuristic algorithms utilize programming logic for efficient decision- making. Introduction to Heuristic Algorithms The term heuristic comes from the Greek word heuriskein, which means “to discover.” In the context of programming, heuristic algorithms are designed to solve problems quickly when traditional optimal approaches are impractical in terms of computational time. The primary aim of heuristic algorithms is to produce a “good enough” solution in a “fast enough” time, rather than seeking a perfect solution that requires unrealistic time. Applying Logic in Heuristic Algorithms Heuristic algorithms often involve rule-based or logical approaches to make decisions. Some examples of heuristic algorithms include search algorithms like A* (A-star), which uses logic to prioritize the most likely path to reach the goal at the lowest cost, or Greedy algorithms, which always make the best decision based on the current information. Here are examples of logic application in heuristic algorithms: 1. Greedy Algorithms: The logic in these algorithms is to always select the option that seems best at that moment, hoping that the best local choices will lead to the optimal global solution. In some cases, this approach might not yield the optimal solution, but it usually generates a good enough solution quickly. 2. A (A-star) Algorithms:* This algorithm uses logic to prioritize paths that seem likely to reach the goal with the lowest cost. This logic allows the algorithm to focus on the most promising paths and ignore paths unlikely to yield efficient solutions. Conclusion In programming, the use of heuristic algorithms leverages logic to achieve efficient decisions in a reasonable time. Although the resulting solutions might not be the most optimal, they are typically good enough for most practical applications. Learning and understanding how heuristic algorithms work can help you become a more efficient and effective programmer.",3

What is Heuristic ? A heuristic is a technique to solve a problem faster than traditional methods or find an approximate solution when classic methods fail or take exponential time. It is used in informed search techniques where the knowledge agent has some guesses about the cost/utility of the further steps and chooses the one which leads it towards optimal solution. Heuristic works on a “best guess” approach to solve problems that are difficult or impossible to solve using traditional algorithms. A heuristic provides a shortcut to problem-solving by guiding the search toward more promising paths and avoiding those that are unlikely to lead to a solution. 8/22 Knowledge Based Agent with heuristic. Let us understand with a real life scenario ! Imagine you’re lost in a huge maze and need to find your way out. You have a map, but it’s very complicated and difficult to understand. You start looking for a way out, but there are so many paths and dead-ends that it’s hard to know which way to go. This is where heuristics come in handy. A heuristic is like a shortcut or rule of thumb that helps you make decisions and find your way out of the maze faster. For example, you might use a heuristic like “always turn left at intersections” to help guide your way. This may not be the optimal strategy, but it gives you a direction to follow and helps you avoid going in circles. Heuristic Function In artificial intelligence, a heuristic function (also known as an evaluation function or simply a heuristic) is a function that estimates the potential usefulness or value of a particular action or state in a search problem. Heuristic functions are used in various AI algorithms, including search algorithms, machine learning, and game- playing programs. A heuristic function is typically designed to provide a quick and 9/22 approximate estimate of the value of a state or action, rather than a precise calculation. This is because many AI problems involve large search spaces, where it is impractical to explore every possible option. The heuristic function uses domain- specific knowledge to estimate the value of a state or action. This knowledge can come from various sources, such as expert advice, statistical analysis, or previous experience. Solving Problem using Heuristic While using Heuristic technique to solve the problem, it gives an estimated cost for all the successors of the particular state. The heuristic function value represents the cost it will take to reach from nth state to final goal. Now this gives the knowledge agent information in prior of taking the next step, here the Knowledge agent will think intelligently and choose the next state based on the minimum heuristic value When solving a problem using heuristic methods, there are several steps you can follow: Define the problem: Clearly define the problem you want to solve. What is the goal you want to achieve? What are the constraints or limitations? Generate potential solutions: Brainstorm possible solutions or strategies that could help you achieve your goal. Evaluate each solution: Consider the advantages and disadvantages of each solution. Which solutions seem most promising? Which are unlikely to work? Choose a heuristic: Select a heuristic or rule of thumb that could help guide your search for a solution. This heuristic should be based on your knowledge of the problem domain and your past experience. Apply the heuristic: Use the heuristic to guide your search for a solution. This might involve testing different options or paths, and making decisions based on the heuristic’s guidance. Evaluate the results: Did the heuristic lead you to a satisfactory solution? If not, you may need to revise your heuristic or try a different approach. Iterate: If necessary, repeat the process with a new heuristic or a revised approach",2
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Searching entails locating a solution or the most efficient path within a given problem space in AI. It requires examining various states or configurations to achieve the desired goal state or identify the optimal solution. Informed search comprises search algorithms that leverage domain-specific information or heuristics to efficiently find the goal state in a search space. These algorithms make informed decisions on which path to explore, avoiding blind exploration of all possibilities. In AI, a heuristic is a problem-solving technique that uses practical rules or educated guesses to find solutions more quickly and efficiently. It provides a guiding principle or estimation to assess which actions or paths are more promising in reaching the goal state. Heuristics are often employed in informed search algorithms like Best First Search, A* search (discussed in a later section)to prioritize exploration of states that are likely to lead to the desired outcome, effectively reducing search complexity. However, the accuracy of heuristics heavily influences the algorithm’s performance and the quality of the solutions found. Best First Search Search: The primary objective of the best-first search is to expand the most promising nodes by relying on an evaluation function or heuristic. It exploits the benefits of both BFS (Breadth First Search) and DFS (Depth First Search)strategies. The best first search can switch between BFS (Breadth First Search) and DFS (Depth First Search) by gaining the advantages of both algorithms. We expand the node which is closest to the goal node and the closest cost is estimated by heuristic function h(n), f(n) = h(n) Here are the steps involved in the best-first search algorithm: 1. Initialization: Start with an initial state as the current state and create an empty priority queue to store the nodes. 2. Priority Queue: Add the initial state to the priority queue, considering the evaluation function or heuristic value for each state. 3. Loop: Repeat the following steps until either a goal state is found or the priority queue is empty. 4. Select Node: Dequeue the node with the highest priority (the lowest heuristic value) from the priority queue. This node represents the most promising state to explore next. 5. Goal Test: Check if the selected node is a goal state. If it is, the search is complete, and the solution is found. 6. Expand Node: Generate all possible successor states from the selected node. 7. Add to Queue: For each successor state, calculate its heuristic value using the evaluation function and add it to the priority queue. 8. Repeat: Continue the loop, selecting the next most promising node from the priority queue. Example: Graph Given Heuristic value In this search example, we utilize two lists: OPEN and CLOSED Lists. These lists help in managing and tracking the exploration of nodes during the search process. Expand the nodes of S and put them in the CLOSED list Initialization: Open [A, B], Closed [S] 3/9 Iteration 1: Open [A], Closed [S, B] Iteration 2: Open [E, F, A], Closed [S, B] : Open [E, A], Closed [S, B, F] Iteration 3: Open [I, G, E, A], Closed [S, B, F] : Open [I, E, A], Closed [S, B, F, G] Hence the final solution path will be: S — → B — — ->F — → G",3
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"information of the essential building blocks for the HH proposed in this paper. First, it is detailed the HH by mentioning their importance, their classiﬁcation, and the most commonly used techniques. Subsequently, the SA algorithm, as well as the Metropolis criterion, are presented. Then, the most used algorithms to deal with multi-armed bandit problems are detailed. Finally, the most commonly used improvement heuristics are shown. 4.1. Hyper-heuristics HHs represent a class of high-level automated search techniques that aim to raise the level of generality and robustness with which search methods work to solve more complex problems. These algorithms explore a search space of low-level heuristics that can be neighborhood or movement oper- ators, heuristic or metaheuristic algorithms. The two main categories of HH are heuristic generators and heuristic selectors. The generation of heuristics are methodologies used to create new heuristics from components of the existing ones. On the other hand, heuristics selection are methodologies to choose a heuristic among a set. The subject of this research will be the category of HH for selection, which controls a set of low-level heuristics during an iterative search process. A generic heuristic selection consists of two key components, which are heuristic selection and move acceptance. As the name implies, the heuristic selection strategy must choose the most ap- 6 propriate from a set of low-level heuristics at a certain point in the search process. While in the movement acceptance strategy, it is decided whether or not to accept the solution generated with the previous component. The most commonly used heuristic selection techniques are listed below. Among the most straightforward methods are random selection and random gradient, which consists of selecting a heuristic randomly and applying it iteratively until there is no improvement in ﬁtness. Also, the greedy search uses all the perturbative heuristics from the available set and chooses the one with the best ﬁtness (Pillay and Qu, 2018). On the other hand, strategies more commonly used by metaheuristic algorithms such as tournament selection and roulette wheel have also been used. In the roulette wheel strategy, each heuristic is associated with a probability calculated by dividing each score by the total score. Then a heuristic is randomly selected based on these probabilities. While tournament selection, a set of heuristics of ﬁxed size is randomly selected to perform several tournaments, and the heuristic that solves with the best ﬁtness is selected (Burke et al., 2013). RL has also been used successfully, assigning scores to each heuristic within the available pool. A score is assigned to each heuristic with the RL methods based on its performance during the iterative process. During this process, by trial and error, the system tries to learn what heuristics to take by evaluating the status and accumulated rewards of the actions (Burke et al., 2013). In the same way, the most commonly used movement acceptance techniques are presented. The simplest strategy is to accept all moves regardless of the quality of the solutions, and another simple approach is to take motions that improve the solution’s ﬁtness. Local search techniques such as simulated annealing, late acceptance hill-climbing, and great deluge have also been used according to each of their speciﬁc strategies (Pillay and Qu, 2018). 4.2. Simulated annealing This metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the physical process of annealing solid metals in metal- lurgy was proposed by Kirkpatrick et al. in 1983 to solve both global and combinatorial optimization problems (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983). Taking the thermodynamic system as a reference, a candidate solution is generated in each it- eration, considering improvement heuristics. The new candidate solution is accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis relation. This acceptance criterion is shown in Equation 2 and is",1
What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"A Deep Architecture: Multi-Layer Perceptron Ninad Lunge · Follow 7 min read · Mar 24, 2024 Listen Share More Before beginning with the Perceptron, it is essential that we have some basic understanding about Artificial Neural Networks. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain’s interconnected network of neurons. It consists of interconnected nodes called artificial neurons, organized into layers. Information flows through the network, with each neuron processing input signals and producing an output signal that influences other neurons in the network. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network consisting of multiple layers of neurons. The neurons in the MLP typically use nonlinear activation functions, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in data. MLPs are significant in machine learning because they can learn nonlinear relationships in data, making them powerful models for tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition. Perceptron: Perceptron was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. A Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. This algorithm enables neurons to learn and processes elements in the training set one at a time. A Perceptron Multilayer Perceptron: A multilayer perceptron is a type of feedforward neural network consisting of fully connected neurons with a nonlinear kind of activation function. It is widely used to distinguish data that is not linearly separable. MLPs have been widely used in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition, among others. Their flexibility in architecture and ability to approximate any function under certain conditions make them a fundamental building block in deep learning and neural network research. Some of its key concepts are as follows: Input layer: The input layer consists of nodes or neurons that receive the initial input data. Each neuron represents a feature or dimension of the input data. The number of neurons in the input layer is determined by the dimensionality of the input data. Hidden layer: Between the input and output layers, there can be one or more layers of neurons. Each neuron in a hidden layer receives inputs from all neurons in the previous layer (either the input layer or another hidden layer) and produces an output that is passed to the next layer. The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer are hyperparameters that need to be determined during the model design phase. Output layer: This layer consists of neurons that produce the final output of the network. The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the nature of the task. In binary classification, there may be either one or two neurons depending on the activation function and representing the probability of belonging to one class; while in multi- class classification tasks, there can be multiple neurons in the output layer. Weights: Neurons in adjacent layers are fully connected to each other. Each connection has an associated weight, which determines the strength of the connection. These weights are learned during the training process. Bias Neurons: In addition to the input and hidden neurons, each layer (except the input layer) usually includes a bias neuron that provides a constant input to the neurons in the next layer. The bias neuron has its own weight associated with each connection, which is also learned during training. The bias neuron effectively shifts the activation function of the neurons in the subsequent layer, allowing the network to learn an offset or bias in the decision boundary. By adjusting the weights connected to the bias neuron, the MLP can learn to control the threshold for activation and better fit the training data. Activation Function: Typically, each neuron in the hidden layers and the output layer applies an activation",3

What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"What is Perceptron: A BeginnersTutorial For Perceptron Antony Christopher · Follow 5 min read · May 16, 2021 Listen Share More Perceptron algorithm used in supervised machine learning for classification. There are two types of classification. One will classify the data by drawing a straight line called a linear binary classifier. Another will be cannot classify the data by drawing the straight line called a non-linear binary classifier. Artificial Neuron In Today’s world time is going fast with the same phase of invention too. The AI solution gives a new platform for machines to think like the human brain. The ANN plays a vital role here basically, it functions the same way how the biological neurons work for humans. To make it a simple context, ANN holds two or more input with weighted values and merge them with mathematical function to produce output. Let see how the biological neurons work. Biological Neuron The neuron is the most important function in our human brain. When we sense some activity from the outside the signal is passed to neurons. Once the signal is received from the neuron, produces the respective output. The output is received back to activity as a response. Perceptron The block diagram illustrates the sequence of input as X1, X2, …Xn with their weights as W1, W2…..Wn. Further, calculate the sum of the weights by applying W1*X1+W2*X2+…Wn*Xn. Finally passed the sum of the weights to the activation function. From the function produces the output. Activation Function The activation function is decision-making for neural networks. This function produces a binary output. That’s the reason it’s called a binary step function. The threshold value gets introduced here by validating the value from the weighted sum. If the value is > 0, then applied classification as 1 or True. If the value is < 0, then applied classification as 0 or False. Bias Bias allows you to shift the activation function by adding a constant (i.e. the given bias) to the input. Bias in Neural Networks can be thought of as analogous to the role of a constant in a linear function, whereby the line is effectively transposed by the constant value. In a scenario with bias, the input to the activation function is ‘x’ times the connection weight ‘w0’ plus the bias times the connection weight for the bias ‘w1’. This has the effect of shifting the activation function by a constant amount (b * w1). With all the explanations, I would explain in better understanding in the real-world scenario. Normally, We do prepare tea for our loved ones, especially in the morning. Consider the example ‘Preparing Tea’ as the objective. Consider the example as the perceptron to prepare the good tea. The very first step will be heating the water and pour boiled water into the cup. Add the tea bag and sugar to get the perfect taste of aroma Finally, stir the tea and remove the teabag. If output gives good tea no change. If the output is bad, need to go backward propagation to change the quantity of sugar/water. Then check the output. Here the input is treated as water and weights are considered as teabag & sugar. We need to adjust the weight accordingly, If there is an error occurred in the ouput. Say here as bad tea. Hope you can correlate with the real-world example here. BackPropagation Back-propagation is the essence of neural net training. It is the method of fine- tuning the weights of a neural net based on the error rate obtained in the previous epoch (i.e., iteration). Proper tuning of the weights allows you to reduce error rates and to make the model reliable by increasing its generalization. Perceptron Types Perceptron algorithms can be divided into two types they are single layer perceptrons and multi-layer perceptrons. In a single-layer perceptron’s neurons are organized in one layer whereas in a multilayer perceptron’s a group of neurons will be organized in multiple layers. Every single neuron present in the first layer will take the input signal and send a",1
What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"PLA: Introduction to the Perceptron Learning Algorithm 📚 Manoj Das · Follow 8 min read · Jun 25, 2023 Listen Share More What is Perceptron Learning Algorithm? Use of Perceptron Learning Algorithm. Proof of convergence of Perceptron Learning Algorithm. Photo by Dmitry Ratushny on Unsplash The Perceptron Learning algorithm is a classic algorithm used for supervised learning in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. It is a binary classification algorithm that predicts whether an input belongs to one class or another. The algorithm was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957 and is based on the concept of an artificial neural network called a perceptron. A perceptron is a simplified model of a biological neuron that takes multiple inputs, applies weights to them, and produces an output based on a threshold activation function. History The history of the Perceptron Learning algorithm dates back to the late 1950s when it was first introduced by Frank Rosenblatt, an American psychologist and computer scientist. Rosenblatt’s work on the perceptron and its learning algorithm marked a significant milestone in the development of artificial neural networks. In 1957, Rosenblatt published a landmark paper titled “The Perceptron, a Perceiving and Recognizing Automaton” that described the basic architecture and learning rule of the perceptron. He proposed the idea of using simple computational units inspired by biological neurons to perform pattern recognition tasks. The perceptron model consisted of a single layer of artificial neurons (perceptrons) connected to inputs with adjustable weights. These weights were updated during the learning process to improve the perceptron’s ability to classify patterns correctly. The learning algorithm employed a form of supervised learning, where the perceptron was presented with labeled training examples, and the weights were adjusted based on the prediction errors. Rosenblatt’s work generated a lot of excitement and enthusiasm, as the perceptron showed promising capabilities in solving simple classification problems. It was seen as a step towards creating artificial intelligence systems that could learn and make decisions in a manner similar to humans. However, in the following years, researchers started to uncover limitations of the perceptron. In 1969, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published a book called “Perceptrons” that highlighted the limitations of a single-layer perceptron in solving complex problems that were not linearly separable. They demonstrated that the perceptron was unable to learn certain logical functions like the XOR function, which required multiple layers of neurons. This setback led to a decline in interest in neural networks and the perceptron learning algorithm. Neural network research entered a period known as the “AI winter,” where progress in the field slowed down. It wasn’t until the 1980s and 1990s that interest in neural networks was rekindled with the introduction of more powerful algorithms and architectures, such as the backpropagation algorithm and multilayer perceptrons. These advancements allowed for the training of neural networks with multiple layers, overcoming the limitations of the original perceptron model. Basic steps of PLA The basic steps of the Perceptron Learning algorithm: 1. Initialize the weights and biases to small random values. 2. Present an input example to the perceptron and compute the weighted sum of the inputs. 3. Apply an activation function (typically a step function) to the weighted sum to determine the output of the perceptron. 4. Compare the predicted output with the desired output for the input example. 5. Adjust the weights and biases based on the error between the predicted output and the desired output. 6. Repeat steps 2–5 for all input examples in the training dataset. 7. Iterate through the training dataset multiple times (epochs) until the perceptron achieves satisfactory accuracy or convergence.
