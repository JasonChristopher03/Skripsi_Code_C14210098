What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"is trained it can validate your future input and can easily identify you. Understanding Unsupervised Learning So, what is Unsupervised Learning? Mathematically, Unsupervised learning is where you only have input data (X) and no corresponding output variables. The goal for unsupervised learning is to model the underlying structure or distribution in the data in order to learn more about the data. Let me rephrase it for you in simple terms: In the unsupervised learning approach, the sample of a training dataset does not have an expected output associated with them. Using the unsupervised learning algorithms you can detect patterns based on the typical characteristics of the input data. Clustering can be considered as an example of a machine learning task that uses the unsupervised learning approach. The machine then groups similar data samples and identify different clusters within the data. Now let me tell you why this category of machine learning is known as unsupervised learning? Well, this category of machine learning is known as unsupervised because unlike supervised learning there is no teacher. Algorithms are left on their own to discover and return the interesting structure in the data. Unsupervised Learning Usecases A friend invites you to his party where you meet totally strangers. Now you will classify them using unsupervised learning (no prior knowledge) and this classification can be on the basis of gender, age group, dressing, educational qualification or whatever way you would like. Since you didn’t have any prior knowledge about people and so you just classified them “on-the-go”. Let’s suppose you have never seen a Football match before and by chance watch a video on the internet, now you can classify players on the basis of different criterion like Players wearing the same sort of kits are in one class, Players of one style are in one class (players, goalkeeper, referee), or on the basis of playing style(attacker or defender) or whatever way you would observe, you can classify it. Understanding Reinforcement Learning So, what is Reinforcement Learning? Reinforcement learning can be thought of as a hit and trial method of learning. The machine gets a Reward or Penalty point for each action it performs. If the option is correct, the machine gains the reward point or gets a penalty point in case of a wrong response. The reinforcement learning algorithm is all about the interaction between the environment and the learning agent. The learning agent is based on exploration and exploitation. Exploration is when the learning agent acts on trial and error and Exploitation is when it performs an action based on the knowledge gained from the environment. The environment rewards the agent for every correct action, which is the reinforcement signal. With the aim of collecting more rewards obtained, the agent improves its environment knowledge to choose or perform the next action. Let see how Pavlov trained his dog using reinforcement training? Pavlov divided the training of his dog into four stages. In the first part, Pavlov gave meat to the dog, and in response to the meat, the dog started salivating. In the next stage he created a sound with a bell, but this time the dogs did not respond to anything. In the third stage, he tried to train his dog by using the bell and then giving them food. Seeing the food the dog started salivating. Eventually, the dogs started salivating just after hearing the bell, even if the food was not given as the dog was reinforced that whenever the master will ring the bell, he will get the food. Machine Learning Using Python On a new tool, it is always good to start with a small project. For example, in this case, the classification of iris flowers on the iris dataset. It’s a good project and is really very easy to understand. All the attributes within the dataset are numeric, you just have to figure out how to load and handle data It is a multi-class classification problem thereby allowing you to practice the supervised learning algorithm 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started # Check the versions of libraries # Python version import sys print('Python: {}'.format(sys.version)) # scipy import scipy print('scipy: {}'.format(scipy.__version__)) # numpy import numpy print('numpy: {}'.format(numpy.__version__)) # matplotlib import matplotlib print('matplotlib: {}'.format(matplotlib.__version__)) # pandas import pandas print('pandas: {}'.format(pandas.__version__)) # scikit-learn import sklearn print('sklearn: {}'.format(sklearn.__version__))   # Load libraries import pandas from pandas.plotting import scatter_matrix import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from sklearn import model_selection from sklearn.metrics import classification_report from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix from sklearn.metrics import",3
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"Let’s break down three key types of machine learning in a way that’s easy to follow. Unsupervised learning is when the computer doesn’t get any labels. It’s like being given a set of puzzles with no instructions. The computer’s job is to find patterns and group similar things together. For example, it might look at a bunch of animal photos and group them based on common traits, even if it doesn’t know the names. The great thing about this approach is that it’s perfect for discovering hidden patterns. The downside? The computer might group things in ways that don’t always make sense to us. Supervised learning is like learning with a teacher who gives you both questions and answers. Imagine showing a computer a bunch of images labeled “cat” or “dog.” The machine looks for patterns, learning what makes each animal unique. Over time, it can predict whether new pictures show cats or dogs, based on the patterns it’s seen. The big advantage? It’s fast because the computer has clear guidance. The downside? You need a lot of labeled data, which can take time to prepare. Reinforcement learning is more like a game. The computer learns by trying actions and receiving feedback — rewards for good choices, penalties for mistakes. Think of training a robot to navigate a maze. It tries different paths, and each time it hits a wall, it learns to avoid that route next time. The benefit here is that it can learn complex tasks over time. The challenge? It takes a lot of trial and error for the computer to figure out the best approach. Supervised Learning: Guided Learning with Answers Reinforcement Learning: Learning by Trying and Failing Unsupervised Learning: Figuring Things Out on Your Own Now you see how these different approaches make machines smarter. From helping us find better movie recommendations to improving game AI, machine learning is part of our everyday lives. What’s a piece of technology that has impressed you recently with how smart it seems? I’d love to hear about it! ",2
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"What is Machine Learning? Machine Learning is simply the strategy of making a machine learn from data. When going deep, we can say that Machine Learning is the subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers the ability to learn and improve on their own experience without being explicitly programmed. Mainly there are three types of methods in which machine learning algorithms learn. They are… Supervised Learning Unsupervised Learning Reinforcement Learning In a supervised learning process, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions called the labels. This means, there are already some data that consist of the desired answers or output in the dataset itself. Let’s understand the concept of supervised learning with an example, take the case of a five-year-old student, he/she is not likely to understand the subjects without the help of his/her teacher. So there he/she needs a supervisor for learning the subjects. In the same way, our supervised learning algorithm is also like a five-year-old child which cannot learn without the help of a supervisor. So to make a model more Supervised Learning efficient, we need to train them continuously with the labeled training data to yield a good result. After the algorithm learns the rules and patterns of the data, it creates a model which is an algorithmic equation for producing output data with the rules and patterns derived from training data. Here we are giving all labels to the algorithm to predict the outcome. Once the algorithm is well trained with the data it can be launched in the real world. important supervised learning algorithms: Linear Regression Logistic Regression Support Vector Machines(SVM) k-Nearest Neighbors Decision Tree & Random Forests Neural Networks Supervised Learning Model Unsupervised Learning Important Unsupervised Learning algorithms Important Unsupervised learning algorithms: Clustering K-Means DBSCAN Hierarchical Cluster Analysis(HCA) Anomaly detection and novelty detection One-class-SVM Isolation Forest In unsupervised learning, the data patterns are not classified. Instead, the algorithm tries to uncover the hidden patterns in a dataset and create labels. This means the unsupervised learning algorithms are able to classify the overall data into groups of data that are quite similar in their features. Suppose you want to identify which type of customers are mostly attracted to your products, you can classify them into different groups using unsupervised learning algorithms based on their purchasing behavior and can identify which type of customers are most attracted to your product. In industry, unsupervised learning is particularly powerful in fraud detection where the most dangerous attacks are often those yet to be classified. Moreover, it is used in spam filtering, fraudulent transactions, fraudulent online activities, etc. Unsupervised Learning Model Association rule learning Apriori Eclat Visualization and dimensionality reduction Principal Component Analysis(PCA) Kernal PCA Locally-Linear Embedding(LLE) t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding(t-SNE) Reinforcement Learning One of the most advanced learning approaches in Machine Learning is Reinforcement learning. Unlike supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning is a sophisticated learning technique that continuously improves its model by leveraging feedback from previous iterations. The learning system is called an agent which gets rewards for good performance and penalties for bad performance. At each time the machine can understand which type of strategy is the best fit to get the rewards and to keep away from penalties. The method of reinforcement learning is used to train robots how to walk, jump, run, etc. Conclusion Supervised and Unsupervised learning is mostly used in industries to build smart systems. Moreover, these algorithms can also be used to create insights on data that are quite useful for data scientists when working on large datasets. Reinforcement learning on the other hand is used mostly in the field of robotics.",3
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, Supervised learning Unsupervised learning 8/9/24, 4:08 PM   6/38 Machine learning - Wikipedia 8/9/24, 4:08 PM  Machine learning - Wikipedia 7/38 dimensionality reduction,[7] and density estimation.[51] Unsupervised learning algorithms also streamlined the process of identifying large indel based haplotypes of a gene of interest from pan- genome.[52] Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity. A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.[54][55] Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.[56] Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms. In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP). Many reinforcements learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques.[57] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not  7/38 assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent. Machine learning - Wikipedia It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.[62] Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.[58] In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the ""number of features"". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction. One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization. Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorization, and",2
What is the definition of Unsupervised Learning?,"find interesting patterns and groups in the data (clustering problem), or we can project it to simpler forms (like with fewer fields), so it is more understandable (visualization problem), or understand how the data is distributed, like for which values they are more populated and which regions are barren (density estimation problem). Unsupervised learning is generally used to understand the domain of the problem and how the data is distributed in the dataset. It may also be used in the data preprocessing stage of supervised learning to understand the data and tweak our model appropriately. There’s a third “group” of Machine Learning problems for which the data is a mix of the two: Some data points have a target, but most are unlabelled (do not have a target). This is usually when you have a lot of data (millions or billions of images, for example) but not many resources to label all the images. This is semi-supervised learning, where only a part of the data is supervised, but the rest aren’t. But essentially, this is supervised learning with not enough data. So, we can consider this a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning instead of making it a whole different group. We will discuss all these types of problems in detail in further blogs. But for now, let’s try out a very simple Machine Learning algorithm. Example — Polynomial Curve Fitting Let’s start with a very simple data (Table 1). The data has one numeric field as an input (x) and one numeric output (target). You can see the data in Table 1. As this is an example of machine learning, let’s say the data is cleaned and preprocessed, and we find out that field x influences the values of the target. We just don’t know how. Table 1: The Data. In our example, the input is just one field (x) with an output (target). We need to find the relation between them and use that to predict the target values for future values of x. The data is noisy, though. We can see that it’s hard to find the relationship by just looking at the table. They look like some numbers put together. However, we can plot it on a graph to see what they look like (Figure 2). Figure 2: The Plot of the Data points. We can see a pattern now. It looks like it’s following a curve. From the plot, we see that it roughly follows a curve. Let’s try to find that curve by writing a formula that will take in x and give out the target. This is called curve fitting — find the curve that fits our data. We can then use this formula to predict the value of the target for unknown values of x. Equation 1: The target in the data is expressed as a function of the input. In reality, we might not perfectly find this function, because of the noise in the data we collect. We find a function that gives a good approximation of the target. The next question is, what type of formula? A straight line? A wavy curve? Or something like a sine or cosine curve? This is our choice. We need to decide what kind of formula fits the data points well. For this example, we will look at polynomial functions. A polynomial function is where the output of the function is the sum of powers of the input multiplied by some coefficients. Equation 2 shows the general form of a polynomial function. Now, all we need to do is find the values of n and a’s in the function so that the value of y matches the target in the data. Equation 2: The output of the model as a polynomial function of the input. Input x is in the data, so our task is to find the best value of n (the highest power of x to consider) and the values of all the a’s (the coefficients of the powers of x) Let’s try with a simple value for n, setting it to 1. Now we have a linear function (Equation 3). The problem is reduced to finding the values of a0 and a1, much simpler than before. Equation 3: A linear function on x. It’s called linear because if you plot this on a graph for different values of x, you get a straight line. We still haven’t discussed how to find those values, though. Let’s come to that later. For now, we will plug in different values of a0 and a1 and see how well the function works. But how do we calculate how good (or bad) our model is? For that, we have error functions (also called loss functions). Error functions calculate how far the model’s output is from the target. One way is just to take the difference between them. Find the difference between the values of y and the target for each data point (don’t forget to take the absolute difference — we don’t need the sign) and add up all the differences. As simple as this sounds, this is a commonly used loss function called Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) or L1 loss. Equation 4: Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) of the model. The higher the value of LAD, the worse your model is. We will discuss more error functions in later posts. Now that we can measure how our model performs, we check the LAD score with different values of a0 and a1 for the data and settle on the values that give the smallest LAD score.",1
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"Preprint submitted to the 6th ASMO UK / ISSMO conference.

Traditional methods present a very  restrictive range of applications, mainly limited by the features  of the function to be optimized and of the constraint functions.  In contrast, evolutionary algorithms present almost no  restriction to the features of these functions, although the most  appropriate constraint-handling technique is still an open  question. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) method is  sometimes viewed as another evolutionary algorithm because  of their many similarities, despite not being inspired by the  same metaphor. Namely, they evolve a population of  individuals taking into consideration previous experiences and  using stochastic operators to introduce new responses. The  advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to  traditional methods have been greatly discussed in the  literature for decades. While all such advantages are valid  when comparing the PSO paradigm to traditional methods, its  main advantages with respect to evolutionary algorithms  consist of its noticeably lower computational cost and easier  implementation. In fact, the plain version can be programmed  in a few lines of code, involving no operator design and few  parameters to be tuned. This paper deals with three important  aspects of the method: the influence of the parameters’ tuning  on the behaviour of the system; the design of stopping criteria  so that the reliability of the solution found can be somehow  estimated and computational cost can be saved; and the  development of appropriate techniques to handle constraints,  given that the original method is designed for unconstrained  optimization problems.  INTRODUCTION  Optimization is the process of seeking the combination  of variables that leads to the best performance of the  model, where “best” is measured according to a pre- defined criterion, usually subject to a set of constraints.  Thus, setting different combinations of values of the  “variables” allows trying different candidate solutions,  the “constraints” limit the valid combinations, and the  “optimality criterion” allows differentiating better from  worse. Traditional optimization methods exhibit several  weaknesses such as a number of requirements that either  the function to be optimized or the constraint functions  must comply with for the technique to be applicable,  and their usual incapability of escaping local optima.  Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) comprise a number of  techniques developed along the last few decades, which  are inspired by evolution processes that natural  organisms undergo to adapt to a dynamic environment  in order to survive. Since these organisms adapt by  seeking the best response to the challenge they are  facing, they happen to perform complex optimization  processes, which can be viewed as processes of fitness  maximization. It is important to remark that, since they  do not specifically intend to perform optimization but to  adapt to the environment, it is frequently claimed that  they are not “optimization” but “adaptation” methods. It  turns out that such adaptation results in optimizing the  fitness of the individuals. Although these methods  typically require higher computational resources than  traditional methods, they do not impose restrictions on  the features of the function to be optimized or on the  formulation of the constraints. Last but not least, they  are not problem-specific but general-purpose methods,  which require few adaptations or none to deal with  different problems, as opposed to traditional methods.  On the one hand, EAs can be viewed as “modern  heuristic techniques” because they are not developed in  a deterministic fashion. That is to say that they are not  designed to optimize a given problem but to perform  some procedures which are not directly related to the  optimization process. Optimization occurs, nevertheless,  despite there not being clear, evident links between the  implemented technique and the resulting optimization  process1. On the other hand, EAs can also be viewed as  “Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques”2, because their    1 Detractors of modern heuristics argue that using them implies  giving up on understanding the real problem.  2 More precisely, “Artificial Life (AL)",1
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"A particle swarm searching for the global minimum of a function Particle swarm optimization In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO)[1] is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search- space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle's position and velocity. Each particle's movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions. PSO is originally attributed to Kennedy, Eberhart and Shi[2][3] and was first intended for simulating social behaviour,[4] as a stylized representation of the movement of organisms in a bird flock or fish school. The algorithm was simplified and it was observed to be performing optimization. The book by Kennedy and Eberhart[5] describes many philosophical aspects of PSO and swarm intelligence. An extensive survey of PSO applications is made by Poli.[6][7] In 2017, a comprehensive review on theoretical and experimental works on PSO has been published by Bonyadi and Michalewicz.[1] PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. Also, PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi- newton methods. However, metaheuristics such as PSO do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found. A basic variant of the PSO algorithm works by having a population (called a swarm) of candidate solutions (called particles). These particles are moved around in the search-space according to a few simple formulae.[8] The movements of the particles are guided by their own best-known position in the search-space as well as the entire swarm's best-known position. When improved positions are being discovered these will then come to guide the movements of the swarm. The process is repeated and by doing so it is hoped, but not guaranteed, that a satisfactory solution will eventually be discovered. Formally, let f:  ℝn  → ℝ be the cost function which must be minimized. The function takes a candidate solution as an argument in the form of a vector of real numbers and produces a real number as output which indicates the objective function value of the given candidate solution. The Algorithm Performance landscape showing how a simple PSO variant performs in aggregate on several benchmark problems when varying two PSO parameters. gradient of f is not known. The goal is to find a solution a for which f(a) ≤ f(b) for all b in the search-space, which would mean a is the global minimum. Let S be the number of particles in the swarm, each having a position xi ∈ ℝn in the search-space and a velocity vi ∈ ℝn. Let pi be the best known position of particle i and let g be the best known position of the entire swarm. A basic PSO algorithm to minimize the cost function is then:[9] for each particle i = 1, ..., S do     Initialize the particle's position with a uniformly distributed random vector: xi ~ U(blo, bup)     Initialize the particle's best known position to its initial position: pi ← xi     if f(pi) < f(g) then         update the swarm's best known position: g ← pi     Initialize the particle's velocity: vi ~ U(-|bup-blo|, |bup-blo|) while a termination criterion is not met do:     for each particle i = 1, ..., S do         for each dimension d = 1, ..., n do             Pick random numbers: rp, rg ~ U(0,1)             Update the particle's velocity: vi,d ← w vi,d + φp rp (pi,d-xi,d) + φg rg (gd-xi,d)         Update the particle's position: xi ← xi + vi         if f(xi) < f(pi) then             Update the particle's best known position: pi ← xi             if f(pi) < f(g) then                 Update the swarm's best known position: g ← pi The values blo and bup represent the lower and upper boundaries of the search-space respectively. The w parameter is the inertia weight. The parameters φp and φg are often called cognitive coefficient and social coefficient. The termination criterion can be the number of iterations performed, or a solution where the adequate objective function value is found.[10] The parameters w, φp, and φg are selected by the practitioner and control the behaviour and efficacy of the PSO method (below). The choice of PSO parameters can have a large impact on optimization performance. Selecting PSO parameters that yield good performance has therefore been the subject of much research.[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19] To prevent divergence (""explosion"") the",2
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"Preprint submitted to Trends in Engineering Computational Technology  doi:10.4203/csets.20.6  1  Abstract    The advantages of evolutionary algorithms with respect to traditional methods have  been greatly discussed in the literature. While particle swarm optimizers share such  advantages, they outperform evolutionary algorithms in that they require lower  computational cost and easier implementation, involving no operator design and few  coefficients to be tuned. However, even marginal variations in the settings of these  coefficients greatly influence the dynamics of the swarm. Since this paper does not  intend to study their tuning, general-purpose settings are taken from previous stud- ies, and virtually the same algorithm is used to optimize a variety of notably differ- ent problems. Thus, following a review of the paradigm, the algorithm is tested on a  set of benchmark functions and engineering problems taken from the literature. Lat- er, complementary lines of code are incorporated to adapt the method to combinato- rial optimization as it occurs in scheduling problems, and a real case is solved using  the same optimizer with the same settings. The aim is to show the flexibility and ro- bustness of the approach, which can handle a wide variety of problems.

The variables and both the objective and constraint functions must comply  with a number of requirements for a given traditional method to be applicable. Fur- thermore, traditional methods are typically prone to converge towards local optima.  By contrast, population-based methods such as evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and  particle swarm optimization (PSO) are general-purpose optimizers, which are able to  handle different types of variables and functions with few or no adaptations.

The lack of limitations to the features of the varia- bles and functions that model the problem enable these methods to handle models  whose high complexity does not allow traditional, deterministic, analytical ap- proaches. While the advantages of PSO and EAs with respect to traditional methods  are roughly the same, the main advantages of PSO when compared to EAs are its  lower computational cost and easier implementation. Regarding their drawbacks,  both these methods require higher computational effort, some constraint-handling  technique incorporated, and find it hard to handle equality constraints.    Population-based methods like EAs and PSO are considered modern heuristics  because they are not designed to optimize a given problem deterministically but to  carry out some procedures that are not directly related to the optimization problem.  Optimization occurs without evident links between the implemented technique and  the resulting optimization process. They are also viewed as Artificial Intelligence  (AI) techniques because their ability to optimize is an emergent property that is not  specifically intended, and therefore not implemented in the code. Thus, the problem  per se is not analytically solved, but artificial-intelligent entities are implemented,  which are expected to find a solution themselves. In particular, Swarm Intelligence  (SI) is the branch of AI concerned with the study of the collective behaviour that  emerges from decentralized and self-organized systems. It is the property of a sys- tem whose individual parts interact locally with one another and with their environ- ment, inducing the emergence of coherent global patterns that the individual parts  are unaware of. PSO is viewed as one of the most prominent SI-based methods. Ei- ther modern heuristics or AI-based optimizers, these methods are not deterministi- cally designed to optimize. EAs perform some kind of artificial evolution, where  individuals in a population undergo simulated evolutionary processes which results  in the maximization of a fitness function, resembling biological evolution.

What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"Particle swarm optimization with Applications to Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Penalized Negative Binomial Regression Junhyung Park1,+,∗, Sisi Shao+,2, Weng Kee Wong2 1 United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, MD 2Department of Biostatistics, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, U.S.A +These authors contribute to the paper equally. May 22, 2024 Abstract General purpose optimization routines such as nlminb, optim (R) or nlmixed (SAS) are frequently used to estimate model parameters in nonstandard distributions. This paper presents Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), as an alternative to many of the current algorithms used in statistics. We find that PSO can not only reproduce the same results as the above routines, it can also produce results that are more optimal or when others cannot converge. In the latter case, it can also identify the source of the problem or problems. We highlight advantages of using PSO using four examples, where: (1) some parameters in a generalized distribution are unidentified using PSO when it is not apparent or computationally manifested using routines in R or SAS; (2) PSO can produce estimation results for the log-binomial regressions when current routines may not; (3) PSO provides flexibility in the link function for binomial regression with LASSO penalty, which is unsupported by standard packages like GLM and GENMOD in Stata and SAS, respectively, and (4) PSO provides superior MLE estimates for an EE-IW distribution compared with those from the traditional statistical methods that rely on moments. Keywords: convergence failure, generalized distribution, log-binomial model, metaheuristics, singular Hessian, unidentified parameters. 1 An Overview of PSO Metaheuristics, and in particular, nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, is increasingly used across disciplines to tackle challenging optimization problems [11]. They may be broadly categorized swarm based or evolutionary based algorithms. Some examples of the former are particle swarm optimization and competitive swarm optimizer (CSO) and examples of the latter are genetic algorithm (GA) and the differential evolution. The statistical community is probably most aware of GA and simulated annealing (SA) but they are many others that have recently proven more popular in engineering and computer science. [24] provides the latest comprehensive review of nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a stochastic numerical search algorithm that has garnered widespread acclaim among scholars across various disciplines. Initially conceptualized by Kennedy & Eberhart in 1995 [23], PSO draws inspiration from the biological swarm behavior of birds, emulating their leaderless yet highly coordinated approach to locate food targets. This intriguing aspect of animal swarms is meticulously captured in PSO. [19] provides an instructive tutorial on PSO and its applications that include chemometrics, signal alignment and robust PCA projection pursuit. Recently, applications of PSO for solving various statistical problems include variable selection [11], bioinformatics [12, 10, 16], design [44, 7], and artificial intelligence in medicine [40]. Accordingly, our overview of PSO is brief as we focus on the aims of the paper, which highlighted in the abstract. PSO is a general purpose optimization tool that requires virtually no technical assumptions for it to work quite efficiently. For a given function f defined on a user-selected compact set S, PSO tackles the optimization problem by finding xmax ∈S such that f(xmax) ≥f(x) ∀x ∈S. The space S can be high-dimensional with or without several linear or nonlinear constraints. PSO works by generating an initial swarm of particles of a given size to search for the optimum by communi- cating with one another and varying their positions as they seek to converge to an optimum. At each iteration, each particle flies to its next position by flying with a velocity and the movement of the ith particle is governed by two equations: xt+1 i = xt i + vt+1 i (1) 1 arXiv:2405.12386v1 [stat.ML] 20 May 2024 vt+1 i = ϕtvt i + c1ut 1 pt i −xt i + c2ut 2 gt −xt i . (2) In the above equations, ϕ, c1, c2 ∈R1,and ut 1 and ut 2 are independent uniform variates from the the in- terval U[0, 1].The superscript t is the iteration number and the velocity of a particle at time t for particle i is denoted by vt i. Adding the velocity to the position of the particle x, yields a new position (1). Fur- ther, pt i is the best position visited by particle i through the tth iteration and is called the Personal best, i.e, pt i = maxx f(x1 i ), f(x2 i ), . . . , f(xt i)   for particle i = {1 . . . N}. The notation gt is the best of all such pi’s through the tth iteration, hence, gt = maxp{f(p1 1), f(p1 2), . . . , f(p1 N), . . . , f(pt 1), f(pt 2), . . . , f(pt N)}. This posi- tion found at iteration t is called the Global best. At termination, it is hope that Global best is the",3
What are the main advantages of Particle Swarm Optimization compared to traditional optimization algorithms?,"communicate the results with each other. These results influence the decision that the team makes in searching further. This is the idea behind Population based metaheuristics. The “exploration vs exploitation” can be achieved through Population based metaheuristics, because the presence of many individuals allows us to explore and the best results obtained can be exploited. The balance is maintained using control variables whose values change with each iteration of the algorithm. The most popular nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms used today are population based. There are two kinds of Nature-Inspired Population based metaheuristics, which are Evolutionary algorithms, which was popularized by Genetic Algorithm and Swarm intelligence, which was popularized with Particle Swarm Optimization²(PSO). Genetic Algorithms are inspired by Darwin’s theory of natural selection. Here the individuals who provide the poorest results³ are eliminated and the other individuals along with their offspring are selected⁴. This process is repeated for a given number of iterations and the position of the individual with the best result is recorded. Particle swarm optimization is a technique inspired from the movement of birds in the sky during migration. Birds migrate as a flock towards a more suitable climate region. When one of the birds in the periphery senses a warmer region, it changes its direction of flight and immediately all other birds follow. Again if another bird senses a warmer region, it directs the movement of the flock again. The movement of individuals in PSO is inspired from this phenomenon. In PSO there are control variables called global_best(gb), which stores the position of the individual with the best score so for, and personal_best(pb), which stores the best position that each individual has visited so far. Each individual moves a little towards its pb and a little towards its gb. The distance that they move in each direction is reduced with each iteration. Nature-inspired algorithms are very useful if the search landscape is not continuous, or if the objective functions are too complex. This makes them very useful for hyperparameter optimization in deep learning. Let us take a simple neural network as an example. Its hyper-parameters are learning rate(α), batch size, optimizer, learning rate decay, no of hidden layers, no of neurons in each hidden layer. All these make up the input vector x in Definition 1. The objective functions fᵢ are the accuracy on the validation set, loss function, precision etc. This problem has many constraints gᵢ. For example, 0<α<1. If we use nature-inspired meta-heuristics to solve the above problem, then each individual with be initialized with some values of the hyper-parameters, and training will happen with all of them. In case of Genetic Algorithm,for example, all the individuals who give large loss will be eliminated and new individuals are created for the next iteration. This process will repeat for the given number of iterations. Accuracy as a function of hyperparameters in a neural network is extremely complex. The hyperparameters determine the number of actual parameters and their values in the neural network. They determine the entire training process. So you can imagine how difficult it would be to represent the accuracy as a function of hyperparameters. So deterministic optimization or simple heuristics cannot solve this problem. Nature-inspired population-based metaheuristics like Genetic Algorithms and Particle Swarm Optimization can solve them reasonably well. References 1. Yang, X. S. (2010).

How is AI used in everyday life?,"system used as an intelligent agent. The concept of trusting machine as a replica of human started with the invent of turing test in which the machine is tested irrespective of the knowledge of examiner upon the instructions given considering it as human and if it passes the test, the machine is considered as intelligent. No wonder AI has affected many aspects of the society and presented a new modern era in this digital revolution. 1.1 Types of AI (Based on Capabilities) The various types of artiﬁcial intelligence based on the capabilities can be classiﬁed as – Weak or narrow AI – General AI – Strong AI. Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 25 Weak or narrow AI: it is a type of AI which can perform a predeﬁned narrow set of instructions without exhibiting any thinking capability. It is the most widely used type of AI in this world. Some famous examples are Apples’s Siri, Alexa, Alpha Go, IBM’s Watson supercomputer, Sophia (the humanoid) all belong to the weak AI type [3]. General AI: it is the type of AI which can perform the tasks like what human can do. Till now it is not achieved, there are no such machines which works like human or can think as perfectly as human, but it may happen in near future. Strong AI: it is the type of AI in which it is expected that the machine will surpass the capacity of human. It will perform better than humans, though it is tough, but it is not impossible. It may be the situation when it can be said that the machines will be the master and overtake humans. It has been considered as a great threat to the society by scientists including Stephen Hawking. 1.2 Types of AI (Based on Functionality) Based on the functionality, artiﬁcial intelligence can be classiﬁed as per the following types: (i) Reactive machines (ii) Limited memory (iii) Theory of mind (iv) Self-awareness. Reactive machines: these are the machines which works on the data available in the form of predeﬁned dataset. It does not have the facility of data storage for storing the past and future data. It completely depends on the present data. IBM’s chess program which defeated famous champion Garry Kasparov and the deep blue system, Google’s AlphaGo are some of the examples for reactive machines [3]. Limited memory: these are the machines which can store the past experience or store the memory for limited period of time. An example for limited memory AI is the self-driving cars (it can store the information like speed, distance, speed limit required for the navigation of the car). Theory of mind: these are types of machines, which are expected to understand the psychological and emotional aspects of human mind and work accordingly. So far such machines are a dream but scientists are working to develop such machines in near future. Self-awareness: these machines belong to a hypothetical concept that will be consid- ered as super-intelligent machines, which can think, act, and will be self-aware as they will have consciousness and sentiments like humans. Research is carried out to develop such machines and considered as future AI. 26 M. Ghosh and A. Thirugnanam 1.3 Domains of AI The major domains of AI (Fig. 1) are neural network, robotics, expert systems, fuzzy logic systems, natural language processing (NLP). Neural networks: these can be described as the representation of human neural system, i.e., neurons and dendrites in the form of layers and nodes representing data. It comprises algorithms that understand the relationships between the data while mimicking the human brain. These are widely used in AI in the form of machine learning and deep learning. Some of the typical examples are pattern recognition of face and image recognition in medical diagnosis. Robotics: it is the domain of AI which is mostly associated with the development of intelligent machines in the form of robot which obeys human instructions. The use of robots or humanoids is a new trend and is being appreciated and adopted worldwide. Robots used in industry, medical surgery, restaurants, etc., are classiﬁed under this category. Expert system: these are systems which make decisions with the help of data present in the knowledge base and getting guidance by an expert. These are basically computer applications developed to solve complex problems with intelligence and expertise. Fuzzy logic system: this domain is considered as resembling the human thinking method and decision-making. It is quite similar to the way humans decide between 0 and 1, but it also deals with all the possibilities between 0 and 1. Examples of fuzzy logic systems used are in consumer electronics, automobiles, comparison of data, etc. Neural network  NLP  Fuzzy logic Robotics  Expert system Artificial  Intelligence  Fig. 1 Various domains of Artiﬁcial Intelligence Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 27 Natural language processing (NLP): this domain deals with bridging the gap of communication between the computer and human languages.

How is AI used in everyday life?,"AI can be categorized into two main types: 1. Narrow AI (or Weak AI): This type of AI is programmed to perform a narrow task like facial recognition, internet searches, or driving a car. Most of the AI encountered in day-to-day life, from chatbots to virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, falls under this category. Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a frontier in computer science, aiming to create machines capable of intelligent behavior. In essence, AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It’s related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to biologically observable methods. Defining AI The definition of AI is often a topic of debate, but at its core, it involves machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include planning, understanding language, recognizing objects and sounds, learning, and problem solving. We can consider AI to be a system that perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Brief History of AI AI as a concept has been around for centuries, with roots in Greek mythology. Modern AI, however, began in the 20th century with the development of the Turing Test by Alan Turing, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called “intelligent.” The field of AI research was formally founded at a conference at Dartmouth College in 1956. Types of AI Recently in technology, two terms frequently come up: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Often used interchangeably, these terms actually describe different, though closely related, concepts in the realm of computer science. The goal of this article is to explain these concepts in a simple, straightforward manner, making them accessible to those with little or no existing knowledge in the field. I aim to provide a clear understanding of both AI and ML, how they work, and what differentiates them. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)? 2. General AI (or Strong AI): This is a type of AI that has a broader range and is more akin to human cognition. It can intelligently solve a variety of problems, learn new tasks, and perform a variety of tasks. General AI is still a largely theoretical concept, with no existing examples as of now. As AI becomes more integrated into our lives, ethical considerations are increasingly important. Issues like privacy, security, and the potential impact on employment are significant topics of discussion. Ensuring that AI benefits society while minimizing its risks is a challenge that needs ongoing attention. The Future of AI The future of AI promises advancements in various fields and the potential to solve complex global challenges. However, it also poses significant challenges and risks that need to be managed responsibly. Various technologies are used in AI, including: 1. Machine Learning: Allowing machines to learn from data. 2. Natural Language Processing: Enabling machines to understand and interact with human language. 3. Robotics: The field of creating robots that can perform tasks in the physical world. 4. Neural Networks: Computer systems modeled on the human brain and nervous system. AI is now a part of everyday life and is used in a range of sectors. For example, in healthcare, AI is used to predict patient risk and improve diagnostics. In finance, it’s used for algorithmic trading and risk management. In the consumer sector, AI powers personal assistants like Siri and Alexa, as well as recommendation systems used by companies like Netflix and Amazon.

How is AI used in everyday life?,"ﬁeld of human endeavor. It was all started in the year 1950s, after its invention by John McCarthy (the father of AI). With time, it has played a signiﬁcant role in helping the human generation to become more advanced and equipped than ever before. It can be mentioned that it has spread the broad spectrum of its application from “the soil to the space”. The 24 × 7 Internet facility, the invention of cloud technology, the concept of big data, sensors, and other technological advancements have turned up as a boon for the development of AI. Although AI has not yet replaced humans completely, it has assisted humans to a great extend in solving and handling the problems which are difﬁcult and risky. In the form of intelligent machines, it has played the role of representative of human beings. Today, AI has found wide applications in agriculture, business, education, entertainment industry, medical, defense, and space technology where it has crucial and admirable effects. It has a great impact in the health sector which has helped to bridge the gap between technology and medicine, in diagnosing the patients. It requires data accuracy and security and the trust of the patients on the system. It has also many amazing applications of robotics in the form of robots performing surgery or assisting in diagnosis. Basically, AI deals with large amount of data to obtain the required results, and accordingly the algorithms are designed to reduce the chances of error and provide accurate results. As already mentioned, the spectrum of its application has spread from soil to space as a booming technology for the betterment and development of human life. Following are few of the application areas of AI and data based on some case studies. 3.1 Agriculture The agriculture is the backbone of any country and hence improving this sector with the help of technology is essential. Considering the world scenario, the agriculture sector shall be capable of producing almost 50% more food than being produced now. The implementation of AI and its technologies has signiﬁcantly played its role in improving the situation of agriculture industry. Going with the phases of farming, AI is used in the analysis of soil and its monitoring, advancement in crop sowing phase, Introduction to Artiﬁcial Intelligence 33 moving forward in the pest/weed control methods and lastly to the crop harvesting and supply of produce to the right place and at justiﬁable rate [15, 16]. With the advent of AI, sensor technology and Internet this industry has beneﬁtted to a large extent. In soil analysis and monitoring, AI can help us to know about the soil and seed relationship. In this regard, it tells which seed should be opted for speciﬁc type of soil. It predicts in reducing the use of harmful chemical fertilizers used to enhance the plant growth and monitors the irrigation method thereby saving water. According to a study done in Alfalfa, California, the use of Geographic Information System (GIS), in the irrigation method has helped to enhance the crop output by 35% and reduction in the amount of water used for irrigation. AI-based apps, basically with the help of sensors, pictures, and infrared rays help to determine the quality and properties of soil. Hence it helps in improving the agriculture process assuring better yield and proﬁt for the concerned farmers. Moving to the next application is the sowing process enhancement by the use of AI sowing app. According to a study in 2016, pilot project with 175 farmers was initiated by ICRISAT (The International Crop Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics) with partnership of Microsoft in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, India whose objective was to increase the level of output (about 30%) with decrease in the investment done prior to the farming. It was equipped with the alert messages provided to the farmers regarding the most suitable dates for cropping, land prepara- tion, and usage of fertilizer using this app which works and gives required results by taking the images uploaded by the farmers from the user end. In another study, the development of machine learning technology along with integrated computer vision applications by Blue River Technologies aimed to optimize the herbicide and pest control. This technology helps to distinguish between the affected and normal parts of the plant. The “see and spray” project of Arkansas, USA, using this technology, got reduction in the required amount of expenses for weedicides per acre of land. In a different study done on the crop harvesting, it was found that the time taken by AI-based robots in tomato farms in Japan, is lesser than the time taken by the human. 3.2 Business, Banking, and Finance This industry or sector is very important and delicate to protect the data and records of millions of customers. The prime factor is the trust, data transparency, and security of the customers. But unfortunately, till date, AI is unable to stop any fraud cases. However,",3

Now, lets look into what each term means. What is AI, ML, and DL? AI: Developing machines to mimic human intelligence and behavior Artificial intelligence is the broad idea that machines can intelligently execute tasks by mimicking human behaviors and thought process using algorithms, data, and models. AI predicts, automates, and complete tasks typically done by humans with greater accuracy and precision, reduces bias, cost and timesaving. What is learning? We learn things in certain ways. How do human generally learn? Remember, generalize and keep adapting to changing things. We will incorporate these things into machines. ML: Algorithms that learn from structured data to predict output and discover patterns in that data. Machine learning, a subset of AI, revolves around the idea that machines can learn and adapt through experiences and data to complete specific tasks. This uses methods from statistics, operational research, and physics to find hidden insights within data without being programmed where to look or what to conclude. Machine learning is used to develop self-learning processing where software is given instructions on accomplishing a specific task. An example would be predicting the weather forecast for the next seven days based on data from previous year and previous week. Every day, the data from the previous year/week changes, so the ML model must adapt to the new data. 8/12/24, 11:00 AM Introduction to AI.

Deep learning is a subset of ML. It is a evolution of machine learning and neural networks which uses advanced computer programming and training to understand complex patterns hidden in large dataset. DL is about understanding how the human brain works in different situations and then trying to recreate its behaviour. For example, deep learning (combined with computer vision) in a driverless car can identify a person crossing the road. Also, used for complicated problems such as facial recognition, defect detection and image processing. We will discuss examples regarding which type of situations to use ML/DL and the benefits of using one over the other in the following sections. When to use AI? Artificial intelligence is used when a machine completes a task using human intellect and behaviors. For example, Roomba, the smart robotic vacuum, uses AI to analyze the size of the room, obstacles, and pathways.

For example, Spotify build a customized playlist based on your favorite songs and the data from other users who share your likes and dislikes. When to use DL? DL is used to complete complex tasks and train models using unstructured data. For example, deep learning is commonly used in image classification tasks like facial recognition. Although machine learning models can also identify faces, deep learning models are more accurate. In this case, it takes the unstructured data (images of faces) and extracts factors such as the various facial features. The extracted",3
How is AI used in everyday life?,"A Brief Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Arpan Thind · Follow 8 min read · Nov 11, 2021 Listen Share More Source:  What is Artificial Intelligence? Artificial intelligence (AI) is the science of making machines smart using algorithms to help computers solve problems, which used to be solved only by humans. Most AI examples that you hear about today — like chatboxes to self-driving cars — rely heavily on deep learning and machine learning. Using these technologies, computers can be trained to accomplish specific tasks by processing large amounts of data and recognizing patterns in the data. A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence AI is not as modern as we think it is. AI dates all the way back to 1950 when Alan Turing created the Turing test. Later in the 1960s, ELIZA, the first chatbot program, was created. A chess computer was made by IBM in 1977, and it beat a world chess champion in two of its six games, while the champion won one, and the other three were all drawn. Apple introduced Siri as its digital assistant in 2011. Elon Musk and some others founded OpenAI in 2015. Different Types of Artificial Intelligence There are several of AI as outlined below: Analytic AI By using machine learning, including deep learning, one of the most advanced methods available, analytical AI can scan thousands of data points to uncover patterns and dependencies, ultimately assisting businesses in making informed decisions. Among the many applications of analytic AI are sentiment analysis and supplier risk assessment. Functional AI The purpose of functional AI is very similar to analytic AI — it scans vast amounts of data and tries to identify patterns and dependencies among them. Unlike analytic AI, functional AI takes actions rather than making recommendations. Using sensor data from a specific machine, an IoT cloud can, for instance, spot a pattern of potential machine breakdowns and act on it. A second example is the robots that Amazon employs to move the goods from the shelves to the pickers, thus speeding up the picking process. Interactive AI Businesses can automate communication with this type of AI without compromising on interaction. This type of AI can be visualized by imagining chatbots and smart personal assistants that can answer pre-programmed questions and understand the context of conversations. A company’s internal processes can be improved by using interactive AI. Text AI The use of Text AI can offer businesses the ability to recognize texts, convert speech to text, and translate content. This type of AI can be utilized even by companies that are not Google, Amazon, or any other giant companies that offer text AI services. An internal corporate knowledge base can be powered by text AI, for instance. When compared with a traditional knowledge base, which relies on keyword searching, an AI-enabled one can locate documents containing the most relevant information even if they do not contain keywords. AI can build semantic maps from natural language processing and recognize synonyms to understand the context of the user’s question thanks to semantic search and natural language processing. Visual AI Businesses can transform images and videos into insights by using visual AI to identify, recognize, classify, and sort objects. As an example, a machine that grades apples according to their colour and size or one that helps insurers estimate damage with damaged car photos constitutes visual AI. Computer vision and augmented reality are areas in which this type of AI can be applied. Self-awareness AI systems that are self-aware are among the lesser-known types of AI that currently exist only in theory. The ultimate goal of AI is to reach this phase. This technology would be explored and developed with the intention of achieving this phase of consciousness. Artificial intelligence systems that are self-aware would be so advanced and so in tune with the human brain that they would have a sufficient degree of self- consciousness and self-awareness. There is no clear estimate as to how long it will take to develop these types of AI systems. AI systems that are self-aware may take decades, if not even centuries, to develop. Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning AI is a vast and growing field that also includes a lot more subfields like machine learning and deep learning. AI, deep learning, and machine learning are often confused as they easily overlap. In its broadest sense, machine learning implies giving computers the capability to learn on their own. By using data provided by humans, machines are able to make accurate predictions using machine learning. It is simply a technique for realizing AI, since machine learning is just a subset of artificial intelligence. It is a technique for teaching algorithms how to make decisions. When one trains their algorithm in machine learning, they have to give a lot of data to it so that it can learn more about the information it has processed.",3
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Heuristic (computer science) In mathematical optimization and computer science, heuristic (from Greek εὑρίσκω ""I find, discover""[1]) is a technique designed for problem solving more quickly when classic methods are too slow for finding an exact or approximate solution, or when classic methods fail to find any exact solution in a search space. This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for speed. In a way, it can be considered a shortcut. A heuristic function, also simply called a heuristic, is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow. For example, it may approximate the exact solution.[2] The objective of a heuristic is to produce a solution in a reasonable time frame that is good enough for solving the problem at hand. This solution may not be the best of all the solutions to this problem, or it may simply approximate the exact solution. But it is still valuable because finding it does not require a prohibitively long time. Heuristics may produce results by themselves, or they may be used in conjunction with optimization algorithms to improve their efficiency (e.g., they may be used to generate good seed values). Results about NP-hardness in theoretical computer science make heuristics the only viable option for a variety of complex optimization problems that need to be routinely solved in real-world applications. Heuristics underlie the whole field of Artificial Intelligence and the computer simulation of thinking, as they may be used in situations where there are no known algorithms.[3] The trade-off criteria for deciding whether to use a heuristic for solving a given problem include the following: Optimality: When several solutions exist for a given problem, does the heuristic guarantee that the best solution will be found? Is it actually necessary to find the best solution? Completeness: When several solutions exist for a given problem, can the heuristic find them all? Do we actually need all solutions? Many heuristics are only meant to find one solution. Accuracy and precision: Can the heuristic provide a confidence interval for the purported solution? Is the error bar on the solution unreasonably large? Execution time: Is this the best-known heuristic for solving this type of problem? Some heuristics converge faster than others. Some heuristics are only marginally quicker than classic Definition and motivation Trade-off methods, in which case the 'overhead' on calculating the heuristic might have a negative impact. In some cases, it may be difficult to decide whether the solution found by the heuristic is good enough because the theory underlying heuristics is not very elaborate. One way of achieving the computational performance gain expected of a heuristic consists of solving a simpler problem whose solution is also a solution to the initial problem. An example of approximation is described by Jon Bentley for solving the travelling salesman problem (TSP): ""Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"" so as to select the order to draw using a pen plotter. TSP is known to be NP-hard so an optimal solution for even a moderate size problem is difficult to solve. Instead, the greedy algorithm can be used to give a good but not optimal solution (it is an approximation to the optimal answer) in a reasonably short amount of time. The greedy algorithm heuristic says to pick whatever is currently the best next step regardless of whether that prevents (or even makes impossible) good steps later. It is a heuristic in the sense that practice indicates it is a good enough solution, while theory indicates that there are better solutions (and even indicates how much better, in some cases).[4] Another example of heuristic making an algorithm faster occurs in certain search problems. Initially, the heuristic tries every possibility at each step, like the full-space search algorithm. But it can stop the search at any time if the current possibility is already worse than the best solution already found. In such search problems, a heuristic can be used to try good choices first so that bad paths can be eliminated early (see alpha–beta pruning). In the case of best-first search algorithms, such as A* search, the heuristic improves the algorithm's convergence while maintaining its correctness as long as the heuristic is admissible. In their Turing Award acceptance speech, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon discuss the heuristic search hypothesis: a physical symbol system will repeatedly generate and modify known symbol structures until the created structure matches the solution structure. Each following step depends upon the step before it, thus the heuristic search learns what avenues to pursue and which ones to disregard by measuring how close the current step",2
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Heuristic algorithms are techniques often used in the field of computer science and programming to achieve reasonably good solutions in a reasonable amount of time, especially when dealing with complex problems. In this article, we will discuss how heuristic algorithms utilize programming logic for efficient decision- making. Introduction to Heuristic Algorithms The term heuristic comes from the Greek word heuriskein, which means “to discover.” In the context of programming, heuristic algorithms are designed to solve problems quickly when traditional optimal approaches are impractical in terms of computational time. The primary aim of heuristic algorithms is to produce a “good enough” solution in a “fast enough” time, rather than seeking a perfect solution that requires unrealistic time. Applying Logic in Heuristic Algorithms Heuristic algorithms often involve rule-based or logical approaches to make decisions. Some examples of heuristic algorithms include search algorithms like A* (A-star), which uses logic to prioritize the most likely path to reach the goal at the lowest cost, or Greedy algorithms, which always make the best decision based on the current information. Here are examples of logic application in heuristic algorithms: 1. Greedy Algorithms: The logic in these algorithms is to always select the option that seems best at that moment, hoping that the best local choices will lead to the optimal global solution. In some cases, this approach might not yield the optimal solution, but it usually generates a good enough solution quickly. 2. A (A-star) Algorithms:* This algorithm uses logic to prioritize paths that seem likely to reach the goal with the lowest cost. This logic allows the algorithm to focus on the most promising paths and ignore paths unlikely to yield efficient solutions. Conclusion In programming, the use of heuristic algorithms leverages logic to achieve efficient decisions in a reasonable time. Although the resulting solutions might not be the most optimal, they are typically good enough for most practical applications. Learning and understanding how heuristic algorithms work can help you become a more efficient and effective programmer.",3
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Searching entails locating a solution or the most efficient path within a given problem space in AI. It requires examining various states or configurations to achieve the desired goal state or identify the optimal solution. Informed search comprises search algorithms that leverage domain-specific information or heuristics to efficiently find the goal state in a search space. These algorithms make informed decisions on which path to explore, avoiding blind exploration of all possibilities. In AI, a heuristic is a problem-solving technique that uses practical rules or educated guesses to find solutions more quickly and efficiently. It provides a guiding principle or estimation to assess which actions or paths are more promising in reaching the goal state. Heuristics are often employed in informed search algorithms like Best First Search, A* search (discussed in a later section)to prioritize exploration of states that are likely to lead to the desired outcome, effectively reducing search complexity. However, the accuracy of heuristics heavily influences the algorithm’s performance and the quality of the solutions found. Best First Search Search: The primary objective of the best-first search is to expand the most promising nodes by relying on an evaluation function or heuristic. It exploits the benefits of both BFS (Breadth First Search) and DFS (Depth First Search)strategies. The best first search can switch between BFS (Breadth First Search) and DFS (Depth First Search) by gaining the advantages of both algorithms. We expand the node which is closest to the goal node and the closest cost is estimated by heuristic function h(n), f(n) = h(n) Here are the steps involved in the best-first search algorithm: 1. Initialization: Start with an initial state as the current state and create an empty priority queue to store the nodes. 2. Priority Queue: Add the initial state to the priority queue, considering the evaluation function or heuristic value for each state. 3. Loop: Repeat the following steps until either a goal state is found or the priority queue is empty. 4. Select Node: Dequeue the node with the highest priority (the lowest heuristic value) from the priority queue. This node represents the most promising state to explore next. 5. Goal Test: Check if the selected node is a goal state. If it is, the search is complete, and the solution is found. 6. Expand Node: Generate all possible successor states from the selected node. 7. Add to Queue: For each successor state, calculate its heuristic value using the evaluation function and add it to the priority queue. 8. Repeat: Continue the loop, selecting the next most promising node from the priority queue. Example: Graph Given Heuristic value In this search example, we utilize two lists: OPEN and CLOSED Lists. These lists help in managing and tracking the exploration of nodes during the search process. Expand the nodes of S and put them in the CLOSED list Initialization: Open [A, B], Closed [S] 3/9 Iteration 1: Open [A], Closed [S, B] Iteration 2: Open [E, F, A], Closed [S, B] : Open [E, A], Closed [S, B, F] Iteration 3: Open [I, G, E, A], Closed [S, B, F] : Open [I, E, A], Closed [S, B, F, G] Hence the final solution path will be: S — → B — — ->F — → G",3
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"building blocks for the HH proposed in this paper. First, it is detailed the HH by mentioning their importance, their classiﬁcation, and the most commonly used techniques. Subsequently, the SA algorithm, as well as the Metropolis criterion, are presented. Then, the most used algorithms to deal with multi-armed bandit problems are detailed. Finally, the most commonly used improvement heuristics are shown. 4.1. Hyper-heuristics HHs represent a class of high-level automated search techniques that aim to raise the level of generality and robustness with which search methods work to solve more complex problems. These algorithms explore a search space of low-level heuristics that can be neighborhood or movement oper- ators, heuristic or metaheuristic algorithms. The two main categories of HH are heuristic generators and heuristic selectors. The generation of heuristics are methodologies used to create new heuristics from components of the existing ones. On the other hand, heuristics selection are methodologies to choose a heuristic among a set. The subject of this research will be the category of HH for selection, which controls a set of low-level heuristics during an iterative search process. A generic heuristic selection consists of two key components, which are heuristic selection and move acceptance. As the name implies, the heuristic selection strategy must choose the most ap- 6 propriate from a set of low-level heuristics at a certain point in the search process. While in the movement acceptance strategy, it is decided whether or not to accept the solution generated with the previous component. The most commonly used heuristic selection techniques are listed below. Among the most straightforward methods are random selection and random gradient, which consists of selecting a heuristic randomly and applying it iteratively until there is no improvement in ﬁtness. Also, the greedy search uses all the perturbative heuristics from the available set and chooses the one with the best ﬁtness (Pillay and Qu, 2018). On the other hand, strategies more commonly used by metaheuristic algorithms such as tournament selection and roulette wheel have also been used. In the roulette wheel strategy, each heuristic is associated with a probability calculated by dividing each score by the total score. Then a heuristic is randomly selected based on these probabilities. While tournament selection, a set of heuristics of ﬁxed size is randomly selected to perform several tournaments, and the heuristic that solves with the best ﬁtness is selected (Burke et al., 2013). RL has also been used successfully, assigning scores to each heuristic within the available pool. A score is assigned to each heuristic with the RL methods based on its performance during the iterative process. During this process, by trial and error, the system tries to learn what heuristics to take by evaluating the status and accumulated rewards of the actions (Burke et al., 2013). In the same way, the most commonly used movement acceptance techniques are presented. The simplest strategy is to accept all moves regardless of the quality of the solutions, and another simple approach is to take motions that improve the solution’s ﬁtness. Local search techniques such as simulated annealing, late acceptance hill-climbing, and great deluge have also been used according to each of their speciﬁc strategies (Pillay and Qu, 2018). 4.2. Simulated annealing This metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the physical process of annealing solid metals in metal- lurgy was proposed by Kirkpatrick et al. in 1983 to solve both global and combinatorial optimization problems (Kirkpatrick et al., 1983). Taking the thermodynamic system as a reference, a candidate solution is generated in each it- eration, considering improvement heuristics. The new candidate solution is accepted or rejected according to the Metropolis relation. This acceptance criterion is shown in Equation 2 and is the key of the SA algorithm to avoid stagnation at local optima. The Metropolis criterion uses the relative quality of the solution and the temperature, which acts as a probability to select worse solutions, to improve the exploration of the search space (Delahaye et al., 2019). pk =  exp  −∆ T  , if ∆> 0 1, if ∆≤0 (2) The original pseudo-code of the SA is observed in Algorithm 1. where the number of iterations for which the local search continues at a particular temperature is speciﬁed by IIter. At the same time, α is the coeﬃcient controlling the cooling schedule, and T0 is the initial temperature equal to the current temperature (T) at the start of the process. The MAcc represents the maximum number of function access allowed (Morales-Castaneda et al., 2019). 4.3. Multi-armed bandit RL methods The multi-armed bandit is a classic RL problem whose name originates from a gambler sitting in front of a set of n slot machines. The objective is to obtain the highest value of the accumulated reward, between each spin",1
What are some common heuristic search algorithms?,"Discovering the Power of Bidirectional BFS: A More Efficient Pathfinding Algorithm Zachary Freeman · Follow 4 min read · Apr 21, 2023 Listen Share More Introduction Pathfinding algorithms are incredibly famous because without them we would still be using paper maps to get around and that would be horrible (at least for me). They address the problem of finding a path from a source to a destination avoiding obstacles and minimizing the costs (time, distance, risks, fuel, price, etc.). There are many algorithms out there to help us get from point A to point B. Some of the most common include A*, Dijkstra’s, Breadth First Search (BFS), and Depth First Search (DFS). The one thing that all of these pathfinding algorithms have in common is that they are all unidirectional, meaning they search in one direction, starting at the source node and ending at the destination node. But what if we start the search from both directions simultaneously? That’s where Bidirectional Breadth First Search comes into play. Let’s learn more. Bidirectional Breadth First Search Simply put, Bidirectional BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that searches for the shortest path between two nodes by performing two BFSs simultaneously, one from the start node and one from the end node. The algorithm terminates when the two BFSs meet at some node in the middle. But if you’re anything like me, you prefer a visual. Visualizing Bidirectional BFS Let’s try to understand how Bidirectional BFS works through the following example. The start node is 9 and the end node is 2 Goal: To find the shortest path from 9 to 2 using Bidirectional BFS Step 1: Start moving forward from the start node (green) and backwards from the end node (orange) Step 2: Just like BFS, at every point, explore the current node’s neighbors until you find the intersecting node Step 3: Stop once you find an intersecting node Step 4: Trace back to find the shortest path Why is This Important? As we’ve just walked through, you can see that this is actually faster than a traditional BFS. Bidirectional BFS requires fewer iterations and fewer nodes visited. As you can imagine, this would be incredibly useful when the size of the graph is very large and the cost of traveling in both directions is the same. Additionally, like the A* algorithm, bidirectional search can be guided by a heuristic estimate of remaining distance from start node to end node and vice versa for finding the shortest path possible. Let’s now look at the implementation and complexity. Implementation Below is a simple implementation of Bidirectional BFS in javascript. const bidirectionalBFS = (startNode, endNode) => {   // Initialize the start and end nodes and their queues   let queueStart = [startNode];   let queueEnd = [endNode];   let visitedStart = new Set();   let visitedEnd = new Set();   visitedStart.add(startNode);   visitedEnd.add(endNode);   // Loop until both queues are empty   while (queueStart.length > 0 && queueEnd.length > 0) {     // BFS search from start node     let currentStart = queueStart.shift();     for (let neighbor of currentStart.neighbors) {       if (!visitedStart.has(neighbor)) {         queueStart.push(neighbor);         visitedStart.add(neighbor);       }       // If the neighbor has been visited by the end BFS, return the path       if (visitedEnd.has(neighbor)) {         return 'Path found!';       }     }     // BFS search from end node     let currentEnd = queueEnd.shift();     for (let neighbor of currentEnd.neighbors) {       if (!visitedEnd.has(neighbor)) {         queueEnd.push(neighbor);         visitedEnd.add(neighbor);       }       // If the neighbor has been visited by the start BFS, return the path       if (visitedStart.has(neighbor)) {         return 'Path found!';       }     }   }   // If no path is found, return no path found   return 'No path found'; }; Time & Space Complexity Let’s assume b is the branching factor (the maximum number of neighbors of any node) of the tree, and d is the distance between the start and end node. Traditional BFS complexity is O(b^d). In the case of Bidirectional Search, we run two simultaneous search operations with the complexity of each operation as O(b^(d/2)) which makes the total complexity as O(b^(d/2)+b^(d/2)). This clearly is significantly less than O(b^d). Conclusion Hopefully by now, you can see how a more bespoke pathfinding algorithm, like bidirectional BFS, can actually be incredibly efficient.

What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"A Deep Architecture: Multi-Layer Perceptron Ninad Lunge · Follow 7 min read · Mar 24, 2024 Listen Share More Before beginning with the Perceptron, it is essential that we have some basic understanding about Artificial Neural Networks. An artificial neural network (ANN) is a machine learning model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain’s interconnected network of neurons. It consists of interconnected nodes called artificial neurons, organized into layers. Information flows through the network, with each neuron processing input signals and producing an output signal that influences other neurons in the network. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network consisting of multiple layers of neurons. The neurons in the MLP typically use nonlinear activation functions, allowing the network to learn complex patterns in data. MLPs are significant in machine learning because they can learn nonlinear relationships in data, making them powerful models for tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition. Perceptron: Perceptron was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. A Perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. This algorithm enables neurons to learn and processes elements in the training set one at a time. A Perceptron Multilayer Perceptron: A multilayer perceptron is a type of feedforward neural network consisting of fully connected neurons with a nonlinear kind of activation function. It is widely used to distinguish data that is not linearly separable. MLPs have been widely used in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition, among others. Their flexibility in architecture and ability to approximate any function under certain conditions make them a fundamental building block in deep learning and neural network research. Some of its key concepts are as follows: Input layer: The input layer consists of nodes or neurons that receive the initial input data. Each neuron represents a feature or dimension of the input data. The number of neurons in the input layer is determined by the dimensionality of the input data. Hidden layer: Between the input and output layers, there can be one or more layers of neurons. Each neuron in a hidden layer receives inputs from all neurons in the previous layer (either the input layer or another hidden layer) and produces an output that is passed to the next layer. The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each hidden layer are hyperparameters that need to be determined during the model design phase. Output layer: This layer consists of neurons that produce the final output of the network. The number of neurons in the output layer depends on the nature of the task. In binary classification, there may be either one or two neurons depending on the activation function and representing the probability of belonging to one class; while in multi- class classification tasks, there can be multiple neurons in the output layer. Weights: Neurons in adjacent layers are fully connected to each other. Each connection has an associated weight, which determines the strength of the connection. These weights are learned during the training process. Bias Neurons: In addition to the input and hidden neurons, each layer (except the input layer) usually includes a bias neuron that provides a constant input to the neurons in the next layer. The bias neuron has its own weight associated with each connection, which is also learned during training. The bias neuron effectively shifts the activation function of the neurons in the subsequent layer, allowing the network to learn an offset or bias in the decision boundary. By adjusting the weights connected to the bias neuron, the MLP can learn to control the threshold for activation and better fit the training data. Activation Function: Typically, each neuron in the hidden layers and the output layer applies an activation function to its weighted sum of inputs. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and softmax. These functions introduce nonlinearity into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns in the data. Training with Backpropagation: MLPs are trained using the backpropagation algorithm, which computes gradients of a loss function with respect to the model’s parameters and updates the parameters iteratively to minimize the loss. Layer by Layer Working of a Multilayer Perceptron: Example of a MLP having two hidden layers In a multilayer perceptron, neurons process information in a step-by-step manner, performing computations that involve weighted sums and nonlinear transformations. Let’s walk layer by layer to see the magic that goes within. Input layer: The input layer of an MLP receives input data, which could be features extracted from the input samples in a dataset. Each neuron in the input layer represents one feature. Neurons in the input layer do",3

They are inspired by the human brain’s structure and function, consisting of interconnected neurons that process information. ANNs typically consist of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. How ANN Works Applications of ANN 4.

Generator: Takes random noise as input and generates data that resembles the real data. Discriminator: Takes both real and generated data as input and tries to classify them as real or fake. Adversarial Training: The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously, with the generator trying to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator trying to correctly classify the data. 1. Image Generation: Creating realistic images, such as faces, objects, and scenes. 2. Image-to-Image Translation: Converting images from one domain to another (e.g., sketches to photos). 3. Data Augmentation: Generating additional training data to improve the performance of machine learning models. 4. Super-Resolution: Enhancing the resolution of images. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, that compete against each other.

What is an artificial neural network (ANN)?,"Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the 2018 Turing Award for ""conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing"".[142] Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or  connectionist  systems  are computing systems inspired by the biological  neural  networks  that constitute animal brains. Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples,  generally  without  task- specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as ""cat"" or ""no cat"" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images. They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming. An ANN is based on a collection of connected  units  called  artificial neurons,  (analogous  to  biological neurons in a biological brain). Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron. The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it. Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers, typically between 0 and 1. Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream. Typically, neurons are organized in layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. Neural networks The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would. Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information. Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis. As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections. Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing ""Go""[144]). A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers.[7][9] There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions.[145] These components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm. For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed. The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label. Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, [146] and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name ""deep"" networks. DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships. DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives.[147] The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network.[7] For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks.[148] Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches. Each architecture has found success in specific domains. It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets.[146] DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back. At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or ""weights"", to connections between them. The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1. If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights.[149] That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data. Recurrent neural networks, in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling.[150][151][152][153][154] Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this",1

In the ﬁrst part, the linear activation function is abstracted from normal activation functions, and the activation integral in continuous form is established. Then the discrete form of activation integral of composite function and multivariate function are introduced. Finally, the standard discrete activation integral of any function is derived, which is the discrete activation integral with linear activation function integrated. In the second part, the activation integral theory is introduced into ANN, and the main network structure types are analyzed, and the corre- sponding function forms are obtained. In the third part, based on the previous theoretical foundation, induct and classify the ANN models, and discuss the structure representation of ANN, the deﬁnition of univariate and multivariate, the deﬁnition of linear and non-linear, and the function representation. In the fourth part, the solutions of ANN and its prop- erties are discussed mainly summarizing the equivalent solutions, symmetric solutions and composed-decomposed solutions of two types of optimal solutions. The application theory based on linear activation function is extended to other kinds of activation functions. Then the standard discrete activation integral weight solution matrix of ANN is pointed out. Fi- nally, the inversion of a solution and a visualization method for studying the neural network are given. Through the above demonstration, ANN can be transformed into function form, and its application is the discretization of these functions. At the same time, the current deep network corresponds to the univariate composite function. It is enlightened that there have a function approximation theory which is similar to Taylor series, Fourier series or other in- tegral transformation theories, mainly based on the composite operation of",2

To make it a simple context, ANN holds two or more input with weighted values and merge them with mathematical function to produce output. Let see how the biological neurons work. Biological Neuron The neuron is the most important function in our human brain. When we sense some activity from the outside the signal is passed to neurons. Once the signal is received from the neuron, produces the respective output. The output is received back to activity as a response. Perceptron The block diagram illustrates the sequence of input as X1, X2, …Xn with their weights as W1, W2…..Wn. Further, calculate the sum of the weights by applying W1*X1+W2*X2+…Wn*Xn. Finally passed the sum of the weights to the activation function. From the function produces the output. Activation Function The activation function is decision-making for neural networks. This function produces a binary output. That’s the reason it’s called a binary step function. The threshold value gets introduced here by validating the value from the weighted sum. If the value is > 0, then applied classification as 1 or True. If the value is < 0, then applied classification as 0 or False. Bias Bias allows you to shift the activation function by adding a constant (i.e. the given bias) to the input. Bias in Neural Networks can be thought of as analogous to the role of a constant in a linear function, whereby the line is effectively transposed by the constant value. In a scenario with bias, the input to the activation function is ‘x’ times the connection weight ‘w0’ plus the bias times the connection weight for the bias ‘w1’. This has the effect of shifting the activation function by a constant amount (b * w1). With all the explanations, I would explain in better understanding in the real-world scenario. Normally, We do prepare tea for our loved ones, especially in the morning. Consider the example ‘Preparing Tea’ as the objective. Consider the example as the perceptron to prepare the good tea. The very first step will be heating the water and pour boiled water into the cup. Add the tea bag and sugar to get the perfect taste of aroma Finally, stir the tea and remove the teabag. If output gives good tea no change. If the output is bad, need to go backward propagation to change the quantity of sugar/water. Then check the output. Here the input is treated as water and weights are considered as teabag & sugar. We need to adjust the weight accordingly, If there is an error occurred in the ouput. Say here as bad tea. Hope you can correlate with the real-world example here. BackPropagation Back-propagation is the essence of neural net training. It is the method of fine- tuning the weights of a neural net based on the error rate obtained in the previous epoch (i.e., iteration). Proper tuning of the weights allows you to reduce error rates and to make the model reliable by increasing its generalization. Perceptron Types Perceptron algorithms can be divided into two types they are single layer perceptrons and multi-layer perceptrons. In a single-layer perceptron’s neurons are organized in one layer whereas in a multilayer perceptron’s a group of neurons will be organized in multiple layers. Every single neuron present in the first layer will take the input signal and send a response to the neurons in the second layer and so on. Python Implementation In this section, we will implement the simple perceptron learning rule in Python to classify flowers in the Iris dataset. For the following example, we will load the Iris data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and only focus on the two flower species Setosa and Versicolor. Furthermore, we will only use the two features sepal length and petal length for visualization purposes. 1 import pandas as pd 2 import numpy as np  3 from matplotlib import pyplot as plt 4 from mlxtend.plotting import plot_decision_regions 5 6 df = pd.read_csv(' hea 7 8 ### select training data and identify label 9 y=df.iloc[0:100,4].values 10 y=np.where(y=='Iris-setosa',-1,1)  11 x=df.iloc[0:100,[0,2]].values 12 13 ###now we define the necessary functions, especiall the fit() 14 class Perceptron(): 15     """"""Perceptron classifier. 16     Parameters 17     ------------ 18     eta : float 19         Learning rate (between 0.0 and 1.0) ",0
